<h1>Machine learning (“decoding”) analyses<a class="headerlink" href="#machine-learning-decoding-analyses" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This week’s tutorial is about how to implement “decoding” analyses in Python!</p>
<p>The term “decoding” is often used to denote analyses that aim to predict a single experimental feature (which can be either within-subject or between-subject) based on patterns of neuroimaging data. Some more advanced techniques make it possible to predict more than one experimental feature at once (with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309006850">Bayesian “reconstruction” techniques</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315006352">“inverted encoding models”</a>), but these are beyond the scope of this course. Here, we’ll focus on machine learning/statistical models and techniques that allow you to predict a single experimental feature.</p>
<p>We’ll make heavy use of the awesome <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> library — the go-to library for machine learning in Python.</p>
<p><strong>What you’ll learn</strong>: at the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>use and implement feature-selection/extraction methods;</p></li>
<li><p>fit machine learning models and predict (new) samples;</p></li>
<li><p>implement cross-validation routines;</p></li>
<li><p>statistically evaluate model performance estimates;</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Estimated time needed to complete</strong>: 8-12 hours<br>
<strong>Credits</strong>: if you use scikit-learn in your research, please cite the corresponding <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jmlr.org/papers/v12/pedregosa11a">paper</a></p>

<h2>Data representation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-representation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Decoding analyses always need two sets of data: the brain patterns, which we’ll refer to as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> (for <strong>R</strong>esponse), and a single experimental feature that we want to predict, which we’ll refer to as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> (which traditionally refers to <strong>S</strong>timulus). Note that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{s}\)</span> could be a within-subject experimental factor (such as stimulus or response-related factors) or a between-subject variable (such as age or depressed vs. healthy control). Moreover, the to-be-predicted variable* can be either continuous (e.g., reaction time) or categorical (e.g., object category), which are associated with different types of models, regression and classification models respectively (more about this later). Note that “direction” of analysis is the exact opposite of what is done in enconding analyses. In encoding analyses, we try to predict the brain data (dependent variable) using experimental features (independent variables), while in decoding analyses we try to predict an experimental feature (dependent variable) using a a set of brain patterns (independent variables)! But essentially, encoding and decoding models are mathematically the same (they just use different inputs).</p>
<p>In the first part of this lab, we’ll work with simulated data. For now, we’ll assume that our data is from a simple face perception experiment in which participants viewed images with either male (condition: “M”) or female faces (condition: “F”) across four different fMRI runs. So, our experimental feature of interest is a categorical variable with two levels (“M” and “F”), making this a classification analysis (which is more common than regression in the context of cognitive neuroscience). Each run, participants saw fourty images (twenty for each condition) presented in a random order.</p>
<p>We’ll simulate the patterns (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>) and experimental feature (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span>, “M” vs. “F”) below. For now, we’ll generate random data (with some autocorrelation), for reasons that will become clear later. We’ll assume that we are restricting our analysis to a single region-of-interest containing a 1000 voxels.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>* Often, the to-be-predicted variable is called the “target” or “dependent variable”. Here, we’ll use the term “target”.</p>

<p>Alright, technically, we have everything we need for a decoding analysis. However, machine learning (ML) and statistical models often require all data to be represented numerically, so we need to convert our target (containing the values “M” and “F”) into a numeric format.</p>
<div class='alert alert-warning'>
    <b>ToDo</b> (optional; 0 points): If you want to practice your Python skills, try converting the string labels of run 1 (the <tt>S_run1</tt> variable below) to numeric labels. Specifically, use the integer 0 for trials of condition "F" and the integer 1 for trials of condition "M". Store the result in a new variable called <tt>S_run1_num</tt>; make sure it's a numpy array. (To convert a list to a numpy array, you can do: <tt>np.array(your_list)</tt> ).

<p>While converting labels to numeric values can be done quite easily using standard Python, it gives us with a nice excuse to introduce some scikit-learn functionality. Specifically, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LabelEncoder</span></code> class, which allows you to <em>encode</em> your target <em>labels</em> into a numeric format. Let’s start with importing it (from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">preprocessing</span></code> module):</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sklearn.preprocessing</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">LabelEncoder</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The way <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LabelEncoder</span></code> is used is similar to some of the Nilearn and Nistats functionality you’ve seen. In short, you first need to initialize the object (with, optionally, some parameters), after which you can give it data to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform</span></code>. This pattern is something we’ll encounter a lot in this lab when working with scikit-learn.</p>
<p>Let’s initialize a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LabelEncoder</span></code> object below:</p>
<div class="cell docutils container">
<div class="cell_input docutils container">
<div class="highlight-ipython3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># LabelEncoder objects are not initialized with any parameters</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, let’s “fit” it on the labels of our first run:</p>

<p>Notice that the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> function doesn’t <em>return</em> anything useful (well, technically, it returns it<em>self</em>). Instead, when calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code>, it stores some parameters in the object itself as <em>attributes</em> which are used when calling the transform. For the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LabelEncoder</span></code> specifically, it stores the unique conditions (often called <em>classes</em> in machine learning) in an attribute called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">classes_</span></code>:</p>

<p>In general, most “things” that are inferred or computed in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> method of scikit-learn objects (and are needed later when calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform</span></code>) are stored in attributes with a trailing underscore (like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">classes_</span></code>). We know, this all sounds incredibly trivial, but explaning these things in detail will give you a better understanding of how scikit-learn works (which is going to help a lot when dealing with more complicated functionality).</p>
<p>Finally, after fitting the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LabelEncoder</span></code> object, we can call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform</span></code> method to actually transform the labels:</p>

<p>Alright, now we have everything we need to start building our decoding pipeline!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standardization">
<h2>Standardization<a class="headerlink" href="#standardization" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the “preprocessing” steps for pattern analyses discussed in last week’s lab, when doing decoding, you additionally need to standardize your brain features (i.e., the columns in your pattern matrix) on which you fit your model. With “standardization”, we mean making sure each feature (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}_{j}\)</span> for column <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>) in your pattern matrix has 0 zero mean and unit (1) standard deviation, which can be achieved as follows for each feature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span>:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-eb74d219-f197-45cd-b025-d0b5798b7705">
<span class="eqno">(92)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-eb74d219-f197-45cd-b025-d0b5798b7705" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{R}_{j, norm} = \frac{\mathbf{R}_{j} - \bar{\mathbf{R}}_{j}}{\hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{R}_{j})}
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\bar{\mathbf{R}_{j}}\)</span> represents the <em>mean</em> of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}_{j}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\sigma}(\mathbf{R}_{j})\)</span> represents the standard deviation of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}_{j}\)</span>. In other words, for each value in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>, you subtract the mean from the column it belongs to and subsequently you divide the result by the standard deviation of the column it belongs to. This process is also known as <em>z-scoring</em>.</p>
<p>This standardization process is done for each brain feature (column) separately. Standardization is important for most ML/statistical models because it makes sure that each brain feature has the same <em>scale</em>, which often helps in efficiently estimating model parameters.</p>
<p>Importantly, when you have patterns from multiple runs (as is often the case in fMRI decoding), these patterns should also be independently standardized, even if you want to pool these patterns later on (see <a class="reference external" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207083">Lee &amp; Kable, 2018</a>). This is because some runs may yield patterns with a relatively higher mean or standard deviation across samples (for example, because participants start moving more towards the end of the experiment, leading to more noisy pattern estimates).</p>
<div class='alert alert-warning'>
    <b>ToDo</b> (1 point): In this ToDo, you have to standardize the data from run 1 (the <tt>R_run1</tt> variable below) using Numpy (afterwards, we'll show you how to do this using scikit-learn). Store the results (which should have columns with mean zero and unit standard deviation) in a new variable called <tt>R_run1_norm</tt>. Importantly, this can be done efficiently (without a for-loop) using broadcasting!

<h2>Fitting models<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-models" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>When fitting decoding models, we assume that we can approximate our target variable (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span>) as a function of the input data (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>):</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-3859819b-b464-4951-bf70-8d7254f13dcf">
<span class="eqno">(93)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-3859819b-b464-4951-bf70-8d7254f13dcf" title="Permalink to this equation">#</a></span>\[\begin{align}
\hat{\mathbf{S}} \approx f(\mathbf{R})
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>Usually, the models used in pattern analyses assume linear functions (especially with relatively little data), i.e., functions that approximate the target using a linear combination of input variables (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}_{j}\)</span>) weighted by parameters (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>). Note that the univariate GLM often used in encoding models is such a linear model. The process of model fitting is estimating parameters that minize the discrepancy (error) between the predicted values (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\mathbf{S}}\)</span>) and the actual values (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span>) of the target variable, both for regression (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is continuous) and classification (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span> is categorical) models. Different models differ in how they exactly estimate their parameters, but the general process is the same (minimizing error between predictions and target). In this course, we won’t go much into the differences across models (partly because in practice, we found that performance doesn’t differ that much between models).</p>
<p>Alright, let’s get to it. Below, we import the <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html">LogisticRegression</a> class, a particular linear <em>classification</em> model (unlike the name suggests).</p>

<p>We are many “options” (often called “hyperparameters”) we can set upon initialization of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LogisticRegression</span></code> object, but for now, we will only set the “solver” (for no other reason that this will get rid of a warning during the fitting process):</p>

<p>Alright, we have some preditions for our data! But how do we evaluate these predictions? This actually depends on whether you have a classification model (with categorical predictions) or a regression model (with continuous predictions). Because classification analyses are most popular in cognitive neuroscience (and our example data is categorical) and you are already familiar with some regression metrics such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R^2\)</span> (discussed in the previous course), we’ll focus on model evaluation metrics for classification here.</p>
<div class="section" id="metrics-for-discrete-predictions">
<h3>Metrics for discrete predictions<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics-for-discrete-predictions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are many different metrics to evaluate the predictions of classification models. The most well known (but not necessarily always appropriate) metric for <em>discrete</em> predictions is <em>accuracy</em>, which is defined as follows:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-db5070e3-f5dc-477d-8000-082732096fba">

\mathrm{accuracy} = \frac{\mathrm{number\ of\ correct\ predictions}}{\mathrm{total\ number\ of\ predictions}}
\end{align}\]</div>
<p>For accuracy, the best possible score is 1 (predict all samples correctly) and “chance level” performance (i.e., the expected score when randomly guessing) is, in general, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{\mathrm{Number\ of\ classes}}\)</span>, so for our example with two classes (“M” and “F”), it is 0.5.</p>
<div class='alert alert-warning'>
    <b>ToDo</b> (1 point): Using the predictions (the <tt>preds</tt> variable) and the true labels (the <tt>S_all</tt> variable), compute the associated accuracy and store this in a variable <tt>acc</tt>.

<h3>Metrics for probabilistic predictions<a class="headerlink" href="#metrics-for-probabilistic-predictions" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Some classifiers allow for <em>probabilistic</em> (instead of discrete) predictions. For those classifiers, an additional method called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict_proba</span></code> exists, which outputs a probability for each class. So, in a two-class classification setting, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict_proba</span></code> method will not give a single discrete prediction (i.e., either <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code>) but a probability distribution over classes (e.g., 0.92 for class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> and 0.08 for class <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code>).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LogisticRegression</span></code> model from scikit-learn actually allows for probabilistic prediction. In general, if we’ll give it all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span> trials for a target variable with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> classes, it will output a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \times M\)</span> array with probabilities:</p>

<p>One often-used performance metric for probabilistic predictions is the “Area Under the ROC curve” (often abbreviated as <em>AUROC</em> or just <em>AUC</em>). Fortunately, the scikit-learn library contains implementations of many performance metrics, including AUROC (called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">roc_auc_score</span></code> in scikit-learn), which can be imported from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">metrics</span></code> module:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>AUROC is an excellent metric to use for probabilistic predictions, but there’s one caveat: when evaluating probabilistic predictions (formatted as a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \times M\)</span> matrxi), it needs the <em>true</em> target values (dependent variable) in a <em>one-hot-encoded</em> format. One-hot-encoding (OHE) is a technique that transforms a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \times 1\)</span> vector with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> classes into a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N \times M\)</span> binary matrix:</p>

<p>While the above ToDo was a nice way to practice your Python skills, we nonethless recommend using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OneHotEncoder</span></code> class from scikit-learn to one-hot-encode your target vector. It uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code>-<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform</span></code> syntax you are familiar with by now. Importantly, as the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">OneHotEncoder</span></code> is, in practice, often used to one-hot-encoded predictors (independent variables), it expects a 2D array (not a 1D vector). So, when one-hot-encoding a 1D target variable, you can add a singleton axis (with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">np.newaxis</span></code>) to make it work:</p>

    <b>ToDo</b> (optional, quite difficult!): Another class of classification metrics are "pseudo $R^2$" scores. These metrics are similar to $R^2$ in regression models in the sense that they are bounded between 0 (chance performance) and 1 (perfect performance). They often assume probabilistic predictions. 
<p>One of these pseudo <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R^2\)</span> metrics is “Tjur’s pseudo <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R^2\)</span>” which is defined as the difference between the average (across observations) probability of a particular class and the average probability of the other class(es) for a given label. So, suppose we’re dealing with a two-class classification problem (with class 0 and class 1), and the average probability for class 1 of trials belonging to class 1 is 0.9, while the average probability for class 1 of trials belonging to class 0 is 0.3, then the Tjur’s pseudo <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R^2\)</span> score for class 1 is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(0.9-0.3=0.6\)</span>.

    <b>Tip</b>: <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/743138v1.abstract">This article</a> by Dinga and colleagues (2019) argues against "accuracy" as a performance metric for classification models and reviews several (often probabilistic) alternatives; a highly recommended read!

<div class="section" id="cross-validation">
<h2>Cross-validation<a class="headerlink" href="#cross-validation" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>If you did the previous ToDos correctly, you should have found that the accuracy was 1 (the maximum possible score)! Amazing! But wait, how is this possible? We generated <em>random</em> data, right?</p>
<p>So, what is the issue here? Well, we fitted the model on the same data that we want to generate predictions for! While this is common practice in many statistical models in psychology and neuroscience (including standard univariate “activation-based” fMRI models), this is not advisable for decoding models. The reason for this is that our decoding models often have many more predictors (i.e., brain features) than observations (i.e., trials). The consequence is that the model has a hard time figuring out what is “signal” and what is “noise”, which will often cause your model to capitalize on spurious correlations between your data (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>) and the target (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{S}\)</span>). The result is that your model will be <em>overfitted</em> and your model performance estimate will be overly optimistic estimate of generalization performance.</p>
<p>To obtain an unbiased (that is, not overly optimistic) estimate of generalization performance, machine-learning based analyses often perform <em>cross-validation</em>. Cross-validation is, in it’s broadest definition, the process of estimating analysis parameters on a different subset of your data than the data you want to generate predictions for (and thus base generalization performance on). With “analysis parameters”, we do not only mean the parameters of your statistical model (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\hat{\beta}\)</span>), but this may also involve parameters estimated during preprocessing and feature transformations (which we’ll talk about later). Importantly, cross-validation (if done properly) allows you to derive an unbiased estimate of generalization performance, i.e., how well your analysis would generalize to a new dataset. Importantly, cross-validation <em>does not solve overfitting</em>; it only <em>detects</em> overfitting. To prevent overfitting, you can employ regularization or feature selection/extraction techniques, of which the latter is briefly discussed in this tutorial.</p>
<div class="section" id="train-vs-test-set-partitioning">
<h3>Train vs. test set partitioning<a class="headerlink" href="#train-vs-test-set-partitioning" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Usually, the subset of data you use to fit your analysis parameters on is called the <em>train</em> set and the subset you evaluate your model predictions on is often called the <em>test</em> set. Assuming that each observation (i.e., row in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>) is independent from all other observations, any spurious correlation that is capitalized upon in the train set will not generalize to the test set!</p>
<p>There are different cross-validation schemes (i.e., how you partition your data in a train and set set). For the example in the next cell, we’ll use a simple <em>hold-out</em> scheme, in which we’ll reserve 50% of the data for the test set (note that this could have been a different percentage). (We’ll discuss more intricate cross-validation schemes such as K-fold in the next section).</p>

<p>After splitting the data into a train and test set, we have introduced a “problem” however: the features within the train and test set may not have 0 mean and unit (1) variance anymore! Given that the features were properly standardized across <em>all</em> samples in our simulated fMRI dataset, this is unlikely to be a problem for our classifier. It is still good practice to make sure your <em>train set</em> is properly standardized. So, before fitting our classifier, let’s standardize the train set:</p>

<p>Before predicting the test set, however, we need to decide whether we want to independently standardize the test set or whether to <em>cross-validate</em> our previously estimated standardized parameters (the feature-wise mean and standard deviation). Although opinions differ on this topic (see e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2756204">this excellent article</a>), if we want a truly unbiased estimate of generalization, we should also cross-validate our standardization procedure in addition to cross-validation of our model. So, to cross-validate our standardization procedure, we do the following for each feature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(j\)</span> of our test set:</p>
<div class="amsmath math notranslate nohighlight" id="equation-13301e81-2ed3-4607-9d6e-5b961f90a9f8">

<p>These predictions (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">preds</span></code>) are made independently from the fitting process.

</div>
</div>
<p>As you can see, accuracy is not perfect (1.0) anymore, but it is still much higher than you’d expect on random data (for which chance-level performance would be 0.5).</p>
<p>In hold-out cross-validation (which we demonstrated previously), you use your train set <em>only</em> for fitting and your test set <em>only</em> to evaluate model predictions. In other words, you only fit and predict once, but on different subsets of your data. If you have a big dataset (i.e., many samples), your test set can be relatively large, and thus cross-validated accuracy on the test set will probably be a good estimate of how well our model will generalize to future/other data. However, if you have a relatively small dataset, you will probably have a relatively small test-set. If you then estimate cross-validated accuracy on this test-set, the chance of just getting a relatively good (or bad) score by coincidence is quite high (see e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191630595X#s0055">Varoquaux et al., 2017</a>)! In other words, the estimate of cross-validation accuracy is not really robust. Fortunately, there are ways to increase robustness of cross-validation accuracy estimates; one of them is by using K-fold cross-validation instead of hold-out cross-validation, in which you divide your dataset into <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> folds, which you iteratively use as train and test set.</p>
<div class='alert alert-info'>
<b>ToThink</b> (1 point)<br>
Can you think of a (practical) reason to prefer hold-out cross-validation over K-fold cross-validation?
</div><p>YOUR ANSWER HERE</p>
<p>As fMRI data-sets often contain few samples (trials/subjects), K-fold cross-validation is often used. Instead of writing our own K-fold cross-validation scheme, we’ll use some of scikit-learn’s functionality. Specifically, we are going to use the <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.StratifiedKFold.html">StratifiedKFold</a> class from scikit-learn’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model_selection</span></code> module. Click the highlighted link above and read through the manual to see how it works.</p>
<p>Importantly, if you’re dealing with a classification analysis, always use <strong>Stratified</strong>KFold (instead of the regular <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html">KFold</a>), because this version makes sure that each fold contains the same proportion of the different classes (here: 0 and 1).</p>
<p>Anyway, enough talking. Let’s initialize a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StratifiedKFold</span></code> object with, let’s say, 5 folds:</p>

<p>Alright, we have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">StratifiedKFold</span></code> object now, but not yet any indices for our folds (i.e. indices to split our <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> into different subsets). To do that, we need to call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">split</span></code> method, which takes two inputs: the data (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mathbf{R}\)</span>) and the target (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span>):</p>

<p>Now, we created the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">folds</span></code> which is, technically, a <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Generators">generator</a> object, but just think of it as a type of list (with indices) which is specialized for looping over it. Each entry in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">folds</span></code> is a tuple with two elements: an array with train indices and an array with test indices. Let’s demonstrate that*:</p>

<p>* Note that you can only run the cell below once.

<p>In a proper analysis, you would fit a model on the train set, predict the labels for the test set, and compute the cross-validated accuracy for all <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> folds separately. Note that, in the case of K-fold cross-validation, you technically estimating <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span> different models (i.e., the estimated model parameters are likely slightly different across folds). For most decoding purposes, this is not necessarily a problem, as we’re often not interested in the model <em>parameters</em>, but the (cross-validated) model <em>performance</em>. As such, people usually compute the fold-wise model performance and subsequently average these values to get an average model score — which is exactly what you’re going to do in the next ToDo.</p>

    <b>ToDo</b> (2 points): In the code cell below, initialize a <tt>StratifiedKFold</tt> object with 4 folds and write a for-loop that iterates across the 4 folds. Use the following additional parameters when initializing the <tt>StratifiedKFold</tt> object: <tt>random_state=42</tt> (this is to be able to test your implementation) and <tt>shuffle=True</tt> (which will draw random folds). Store this object in a variable named <tt>skf_4f</tt>.
<p>In every iteration, divide the data into a train and test set, apply (cross-validated) standardization, fit the  model (you can reuse the <tt>LogisticRegression</tt> object from before) on the train set, predict the test set, and compute the accuracy. Store the accuracy for each iteration. After the loop, you should have 4 cross-validated accuracy scores. Average these and store the result (a single number) in a variable named <tt>acc_cv_average</tt>.</p>

    <b>Tip</b>: you might wonder how many folds you should choose. It is tempting to choose as many folds as possible, i.e. to make your train set as big as possible, such that your model has as much data as possible to train on. The flip side, however, is that your test set becomes smaller with larger train sets, which tends to lead to highly variable cross-validated model performance estimates (e.g., 0.9 in one fold, but 0.35 in the other fold). It has been recommended to use a test set size of about 10%-20% of the size of your entire dataset (i.e., using 5-10 folds; see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191630595X#s0055">this article</a>).

<p>As you might have noticed in the previous ToDo, it takes quite some lines of code to fully cross-validate your standardization step and model: fit your scaler on the train set, transform the train set, transform the test set, fit your model on the train set, and finally predict your test set. This cross-validation routine will only become more complicated and cumbersome when you add extra preprocessing or transformation procedures to it (as we’ll do in the next section). As such, let us introduce one of the most amazing features of scikit-learn: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipelines</span></code>.</p>
<div class='alert alert-warning'>
    <b>ToDo</b> (0 points): Read through the documentation of the <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html">Pipeline class</a>.
</div><p>Scikit-learn <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipeline</span></code>s allow you to “bundle together” a sequence of analysis steps (which may include preprocessing and feature transformation operations) that usually ends in a model (e.g., a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LogisticRegression</span></code> object). Then, you can fit all steps on a particular subset of data by calling the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipeline</span></code>’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit</span></code> method and subsequently call the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict</span></code> method on another subset of data, which will <em>automatically cross-validate every step in your analysis pipeline</em>. Instead of initializing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipeline</span></code> objects directly, we’ll use the convenience function <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make_pipeline</span></code>:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>Now, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make_pipeline</span></code> function accepts an arbitrary number of arguments which should all be either preprocessing or feature transformation objects (i.e., so-called <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html">transformator</a> objects) or model objects (i.e., so-called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">estimator</span></code> objects), such as a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LogisticRegression</span></code> object. Note that you can only have a single model object in your pipeline, which should be the <em>last</em> step in your pipeline.</p>
<p>Let’s create a very simple pipeline that involves standardization and a logistic regression model (like you implemented in the previous ToDo):</p>

<p>Now, let’s use the data from the simple hold-out split from before to demonstrate the fiting and cross-validation of our complete pipeline.

<p>Awesome, right? Using pipelines saves you many lines of code and allows you to easily cross-validate entire pipelines. You’ll practice with pipelines in the upcoming ToDo.</p>
<p>Now, back to cross-validation routines. One notable variant of K-fold cross-validation is <em>repeated</em> stratified K-fold cross-validation, in which the cross-validation loop is repeated several times with different (random) folds. This way, the cross-validated model performance estimates usually become more stable (i.e., less variance). (Of course, scikit-learn contains a <a class="reference external" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.RepeatedStratifiedKFold.html#sklearn.model_selection.RepeatedStratifiedKFold">RepeatedStratifiedKFold</a> class.)</p>
<p>Another notable cross-validation scheme, especially for fMRI-based decoding analyses, is group-based cross-validation, in which folds are created based on a particular grouping variable. In fMRI-based decoding analyses, this type of cross-validation is often applied to cross-validate models across runs. Specifically, the leave-one-run-out technique is often used, in which a model is fit on all trials except the trials from a single run (the train set) and is cross-validated to the trials of the left-out run (the test set).</p>
<p>This functionality is implemented in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LeaveOneGroupOut</span></code> class in scikit-learn:</p>

    <b>ToThink</b> (1 point): The average performance for the leave-one-run-out cross-validation analysis is, unlike the previous stratified K-fold results (which should be considerably above chance), near chance-level, as you would expect for random noise data. Explain why run-wise cross-validation solves the bias that we observed when ignoring the trial structure across runs. Hint: look at the way we simulated data (which reflects what real data may look like).

<h2>Class imbalance and model performance revisited<a class="headerlink" href="#class-imbalance-and-model-performance-revisited" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Before moving on to more exciting aspects of decoding pipelines, let’s discuss class imbalance. Class imbalance, the situation in which not all classes within your target variable have the same number of samples, can have a big impact on your classification model (note: this is not relevant for regression models, as they don’t have <em>classes</em>!). This is not uncommon in decoding models, especially when you don’t have control over the feature of interest, such as response-based features (e.g., whether the participant pressed left or right) or between-subjects variables (e.g., when dealing with clinical populations, which cannot always be perfectly balanced due to practical reasons).</p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s look at what happens with random data and a imbalanced target variable. We’ll simulate some random data (like our previously used data, this contains no “signal” at all: you’d expect 50% accuracy) a couple of times and we’ll calculate the cross-validated accuracy.</p>

<p>When running the cell above, you should find that the models is able to consistently yield strong above-chance performance, which shouldn’t happen because the data that we simulated is just random noise!</p>
<div class='alert alert-warning'>
    <b>ToDo</b> (0 points): Try setting the <tt>ratio01</tt> variable to other numbers (in between 0.1 - 1), for example 0.9, 0.2, or 0.5, and see what happens with the cross-validated accuracy score!
</div><div class='alert alert-info'>
<b>ToThink</b> (1 point): Suppose that you have a dataset with a binary target variable ($S = \{0, 1\}$) a train set in which 80% of the samples are of class 0 and a test set in which 80% of the samples are of class 1. Assuming similar parameters ($N$, $K$, type of classifier, etc.) as used in the previous simulation, what do you think will be the (cross-validated) accuracy on the test set? Why?
</div><p>YOUR ANSWER HERE</p>
<p>As you can see, the model “learns” to just predict the majority class (the class with the most samples)! In a way, class imbalance also provides the classifier with a source of “information” that it can use to derive accurate (but theoretically meaningless) predictions.</p>
<p>Therefore, imbalanced datasets therefore need a different evaluation metric than accuracy. Fortunately, scikit-learn has many more performance metrics you can use, including metrics that “correct” for the (potential) bias due to class imbalance (including <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score">f1-score</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html#sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score">ROC-AUC-score</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.balanced_accuracy_score.html">balanced-accuracy score</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score.html#sklearn.metrics.cohen_kappa_score">Cohen’s Kappa</a>).</p>
<p>Let’s check out what happens with our performance estimate if we use a different (‘class-imbalance-aware’) metric, the “ROC-AUC-score” we discussed previously, which should take care of the bias induced by imbalance.</p>

<p>Much better! In addition to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">roc_auc_score</span></code>, there are other metrics (such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">balanced_accuracy</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">f1_score</span></code>) that deal appropriately with class imbalance.</p>
<p>However, using class-imbalance-aware metrics only makes sure that the model performance estimate is unbiased (i.e., is not affected by class imbalance), but it doesn’t prevent the model from actually “learning” the useless “information” related to class imbalance (instead of learning the true/useful signal in the data)! In our previous examples which used completely random (null) data, this is not a problem, but it <em>is</em> a problem when the data actually contains some effect. One way to counter this is by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">class_weight</span></code> parameter that is available in mode scikit-learn models. Setting the parameter to “balanced” will weigh samples from the minority class more strongly than samples from the majority class, forcing the model to learn information that is independent from class frequency. Below, we initialize a logistic regression model with this setting enabled and show that it effectively reduces the influence of class imbalance:</p>

<h2>Feature selection/extraction<a class="headerlink" href="#feature-selection-extraction" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Now that we’ve dicussed cross-validation, which allows you to report an unbiased estimate of generalization performance. However, especially when your data contains many brain features (e.g., voxels), your model might still perform poorly simply because it has a hard time distinguishing signal from noise. One way to “help” our model a little is to apply feature selection and/or extraction techniques, which are meant to reduce the number of features to a smaller subset which, hopefully, contain more signal (and less noise).</p>
<p>Feature reduction can be achieved in two principled ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>feature extraction: transform your features into a set of lower-dimensional components;</p></li>
<li><p>feature selection: select a subset of features</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of feature extraction are PCA (i.e. transform voxels to orthogonal components) and averaging features within brain regions from an atlas.</p>
<p>Examples of feature selection are ROI-analysis (i.e. restricting your patterns to a specific ROI in the brain) and “univariate feature selection” (UFS). This latter method is an often-used data-driven method to select features based upon their univariate difference, which is basically like using a traditional whole-brain mass-univariate analysis to select potentially useful features!</p>
<div class='alert alert-info'>
<b>ToThink</b> (1 point): Suppose a researcher wants to decode gratings with two different orientations from V1. To delineate V1, the subject underwent a retinotopy session in a <em>different</em> fMRI run. The data from this retinotopy session was subsequently used to extract ("mask") V1 by excluding non-significant voxels; the significant voxels were in turn used to base the orientation decoding analysis on. Is masking V1 using the retinotopy data a form of <em>feature selection</em> or <em>feature extraction</em>? Why? 
</div><p>YOUR ANSWER HERE</p>
<p>Fortunately, scikit-learn has a bunch of feature selection/extraction objects for us to use. These objects (“transformers” in scikit-learn lingo) work similarly to models (“estimators”): they also have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">fit(R,</span> <span class="pre">S)</span></code> method, in which for example the univariate differences (in UFS) or PCA-components (in PCA-driven feature extraction) are computed. Then, instead of having a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">predict(R)</span></code> method, transformers have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">transform(R)</span></code> method.</p>
<p>Before going on, let’s actually load in some <em>real</em> data. We’ll use the data from a single “face” run from subject 03. We already estimated the single-trial patterns on Fmriprep-preprocessed data for you using Nilearn (you can check out the code <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/lukassnoek/NI-edu-data/blob/master/code/nipa/estimate_patterns.py">here</a>).

    <b>ToThink</b> (1 point): The patterns we just loaded in were already normalized to a common (MNI) template. This is convenient when we want to apply masks derived from atlases (which are often defined in MNI space). But can you also think of an argument for analyzing the data in subject-native space (i.e., data that has not been normalized to a common template)?

<div class="section" id="roi-selection">
<h3>ROI selection<a class="headerlink" href="#roi-selection" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>An often used method to reduce the number of brain features is to restrict analyses to a particular region-of-interest (ROI), which can either be defined anatomically (e.g., the amygdala) or functionally (e.g., the voxels that activate significantly more to faces than to houses in a separate localizer run). For this section, we’ll focus on selecting a subset of voxels based on an anatomical ROI. What ROI we can use depends on the <em>space</em> of the data, i.e., whether the data has been normalized to a common template (usually MNI152) or not. Previously, we loaded in data that has been normalized to “MNI152NLin2009cAsym” space (the specific MNI flavor used by Fmriprep). As such, we can use ROIs from atlases that are defined in MNI space, such as the Harvard-Oxford atlas, which we can load using Nilearn:</p>

<h3>Region averaging<a class="headerlink" href="#region-averaging" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>So far, we have restricted our analyses mostly to voxel patterns within a single ROI. For some research questions, however, you might want to include whole-brain patterns (for example, if you believe your experimental feature of interest is represented in whole-brain networks). This means, however, that you might be dealing with a lot of voxels (i.e., columns in your pattern matrix)! Again, you could reduce the number of features using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA. An alternative is to not use the activity of <em>voxels</em> as features, but the region-average activity! These regions can for example be derived from an existing anatomical atlas or parcellation or even from your own data (by fitting a clustering algorithm on the underlying timeseries).</p>

<h3>Searchlight analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#searchlight-analysis" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>One last technique that we want to discuss before moving on to statistical testing of decoding results is <em>searchlight analysis</em> (although it’s not <em>really</em> a feature selection/extraction technique). <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3863.short">Searchlight analysis</a> is a decoding-based analysis that is kind of a hybrid between univariate and multivariate analysis: it analyzes local voxel <em>patterns</em> but does that for every location in the brain. It does so by defining a spherical “searchlight” of voxels around a particular center voxel (with a particular radius). Within this searchlight, a (cross-validated) decoding analysis is performed and the result, usually a foldwise average model performance score (e.g., accuracy), is assigned to the center voxel. Then, the searchlight moved to the next voxel and a new decoding analysis performed; this process is repeated until each voxel has been the center voxel (and has been assigned a model performance score). As such, at the end of the searchlight analysis, you have an entire volume of (average) model performances, not just a single one!</p>
<p>Nilearn contains an efficient implementation of a searchlight analysis:</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">radius</span></code>: radius (in mm) of the searchlight sphere;</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">estimator</span></code>: a scikit-learn compatible estimator (which can be a classifier/regression model or a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pipeline</span></code>!)</p></li>

<p>Now, let’s go through these arguments one by one. First, to determine a brain mask, let’s just simply include all voxels that contain at least <em>some</em> signal across trials (i.e., where the sum across trials is not 0):</p>

<p>Suppose you ran your decode pipeline on twenty subjects and accordingly collected a set of twenty model performance scores (e.g., accuracy for a two-class target). Inevitably, some scores will be higher (e.g., 0.9) than others (e.g., 0.7), and some may even be at or below chance level (e.g., 0.45). In the same vein, suppose you ran your decode pipeline across the gray-matter density patterns of a 100 subjects (of which 50 are diagnosed with major depression and 50 are healthy controls) in a 10-fold cross-validation scheme, yielding tne (foldwise) model performance scores. Again, the magnitude of these scores may differ. How do we determine if these scores are, in fact, significantly higher than we’d expect by chance?</p>
<p>Significance tests for within-subject decoding analyses can be done in two ways. The “easy” way is to simply do a one-sample <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>-test against chance-level (e.g., 0.5 for a two-class target) on the subject-wise model performance scores. For example, suppose that our analyses have produced the following model performance scores (e.g., accuracy, averaged across folds):</p>

<p>If we’d use a significance level (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>) of 0.05, this would mean that our result is statistically significant — yay! This simple approach is, however, technically not a completely valid (random effects) analysis as shown by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916303470?casa_token=XqSuI7NmrQMAAAAA:AKGyrgT-Z12RwzyRSzE7L5cTsezjtSu3VRSKddahRSNDsz4XltgsMp7kjnxlz5avIqsltySRQbw">Allefeld and colleagues (2016)</a>, because a one-sample t-test assumes a symmetric distribution centered at chance-level, but below chance-level model performance <em>in the population</em> is impossible. This is like testing commute time of people against a null-hypothesis of 0, which doesn’t make sense, because you cannot have a negative commute time! Allefeld and colleagues propose a solution, which they call “prevalence inference”, which involves intricate permutation testing procedures and is a bit too complicated for this course. If you ever need to evaluate decoding performance at the group-level, though, we highly recommend trying to implement this method.</p>
<div class='alert alert-success'>
    <b>Tip</b>: If you want to know more about prevalence inference and want to see some example code, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/lukassnoek/random_notebooks/blob/master/prevalence_inference.ipynb">this notebook</a>.
</div><p>That said, let’s look at how we’d statistically test the results of <em>between-subject</em> analyses. We cannot use a simple one-sample <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>-test for between-subject results, because data points in between-subject analyses — usually the model performance scores associated with different folds in K-fold CV — are <em>not independent</em>, which is an important assumption of all parametric statistics (such as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span>-tests). Dependence between data points is created because the same samples may be included in different folds. As such, we need a different, non-parameteric approach to evaluate statistical significance: permutation testing.</p>
<p>In the previous sections of this tutorial, we worked with within-subject data from a single subject, but for this section, we’ll need some between-subject data. For this, we’ll use voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data from 47 subjects. We’ll use these voxelwise gray matter volume patterns in the bilateral caudate to predict subject gender (male vs. female). Although theoretically meaningless, this allows us to demonstrate permutation testing.</p>
<p>First, let’s load in and prepare the data:</p>

<p>Before you start with anything related to permutation testing, you first need to get your performance score that you would like to get a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-values for. In between-subject decoding analyses, this is usually the average accuracy (or whatever other metric) across folds. So, when you would implement a 3-fold cross-validation scheme, your observed performance score would be the average of the accuracy-estimates across those 3 folds. You know what?

<p>Alright, not bad! 63.6% correct is higher than chance, but is it also <em>significantly</em> higher than chance? For that, we need to “simulate” a null-distribution through permutation!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-your-permuted-performance-distribution">
<h3>Getting your <em>permuted</em> performance distribution<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-your-permuted-performance-distribution" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The goal of permutation tests are to create a null-distribution of your observed measure, in this case: (average) classification accuracy. The null-distribution refers to the distribution of classification accuracies that would arise if you would repeat an experiment with noisy data in which there is no effect (i.e. the null-hypothesis is true).</p>
<p>Thus, we need to somehow repeat the above “experiment” (i.e. the analysis which yielded the observed performance of 51.1%) yet while the null-hypothesis is true (i.e. there is no effect, only noise). Well, as the term “permutation” suggest, we can simply randomly shuffly the train-labels (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S_train</span></code>) to generate random labels. Now, if we would fit the classifier on {<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R_train</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S_train</span></code>}, then practically it would fit on noise. In fact, by random shuffling of the train-labels, we simulated the scenario in which (on average) the null-hypothesis would be true.</p>
<p>So, what we need to do in order to create a null-distribution of classification-accuracies is to run our original analysis (in the code cell above) many times (i.e. “repeat the experiment”), yet with random labeling of our train-samples. We expect that the mean of these null-accuracies would center around .5 (assumed chance level), but simply due to random noise, our simulated null-distribution will contain values (sometimes substantially) above and below chance level.</p>
<p>Anyway, look at the code-cell below. It contains exactly the same analysis as in the above code-block, yet now it is looped 100 times, and just before fitting (within every fold separately) we shuffle the train-labels to generate a random mapping between <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R_train</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">S_train</span></code>. After every “experiment” (or simply “permutation”) we average the permuted accuracy scores across folds and store them (in the variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">permuted_accuracies</span></code>). Now, let’s run the code cell below (may take minute or two):</p>

    <b>ToDo</b> (2 points): For this final ToDo, we are going to throw you in at the deep end. Instead of a classification analysis, you are going to implement a regression analysis, in which you'll try to predict 'average attractiveness' (i.e., the attractiveness ratings for our stimuli given by an external set of subjects), which we defined for you already (the variable <tt>S</tt>, below). For the patterns, you can reuse the <tt>R_4D</tt> variable. However, you need to index this with a "Frontal Orbital Cortex" ROI from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (also defined below: <tt>ho_atlas</tt>). Note, you have to define the ROI yourself (including resampling to match the resolution of the patterns). <br><br>Then, construct a pipeline with a <tt>StandardScaler</tt> and a <tt>Ridge</tt> regression model (from the <tt>linear_model</tt> module; do not use any specific arguments during initialization). Using a 4-fold cross-validation routine (using the <tt>KFold</tt> class from the <tt>model_selection</tt> module), compute the cross-validated mean squared error (either manually or using the <tt>mean_squared_error</tt> function from the <tt>metrics</tt> module) each iteration. Finally, average the four mean squared error values and store this in a variable named <tt>av_mse</tt>. <br>
<p>A couple of pointers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You need to import all (new) classes and functions yourself;</p></li>
<li><p>Realize that scikit-learn uses a consistent interface for its classes, whether they are regression-related or classification-related (e.g., a regression model has largely the same methods as classification models);</p></li>
