    "## Why do we need MCC?\n",
    "Univariate analyses of fMRI data essentially test hypotheses about your data (operationalized as contrasts between your $\\hat{\\beta}$ estimates) *for each voxel* separately. So, in practice, given that the MNI (2 mm) standard template brain contains about 260,000 voxels, you're conducting 260,000 different statistical tests! The obvious problem, here, is that some tests might turn out significant, while they in fact do not contain any (task-related) activity: the result is driven just by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a researcher, you should strive to \"filter out\" the results which are driven by noise (*false positives*) and keep the results which are actually driven by the true effect (*true positives*) as much as possible. It turns out that the more tests you do, the larger the chance is that you will find one or more *false positives*. To deal with this, researchers often employ techniques for *multiple comparison correction* (MCC): **correcting** for the inflated chance of false positives when you have **multiple** tests (**comparisons**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will walk you through an example (simulated) dataset on which different MCC techniques are employed. We'll focus on how these different techniques influence the chance for finding false positives."

    "As you've seen so far, uncorrected results tend to be too liberal (too many false positives) and Bonferroni-corrected results are too strict (too many false negatives). The \"False Discovery Rate-correction\" (FDR) technique is a method to adjust $p$-values in a less stringent way. Essentially, while traditional MCC methods (such as Bonferroni) try to control the chance of finding at least one false positive result **amongst all your tests** (i.e. controlling the \"familywise error rate\" method), the FDR-method tries to limit the proportion of false positives **amongst all your tests which turned out significant**. So, if you set your \"FDR-proportion\" (confusingly also referred to as \"alpha\") to 0.05, then it will adjust your initial $p$-values such that out of all your significant results, on average 5% will be false positives.  \n",

    "As you've seen in the previous examples, it's quite hard to pick a significance level that strikes a good balance between type 1 errors and type 2 errors, or, phrased differently, between sensitivity (with respect to discovering the true signal) and specificy (i.e. how many of our significant voxels are driven by a true effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to the results of the Bonferroni correction. We've seen that the results are extremely conservative (few false positives, but many false negatives, i.e. large type 2 error). The major reason for this is that the correction assumes that each test is *independent*, but in our simulation (and in any fMRI dataset), we *know* that there exists spatial correlation, meaning that our tests are *not* independent. In other words, if we know that a certain voxel is signficant in a certain test, it is quite likely that the voxel directly *next* (or above/below) to it is also significant. Therefore, spatially correlated fMRI statistic maps violate Bonferroni's assumption of independent tests (this is also the answer to the ToThink from earlier).\n",

    "### Cluster-level RFT\n",
    "In all the previous MCC techniques, we have used voxel-level corrections, which resulting $p$-values tell us something about whether the *height* of a voxel's statistic (often referred to as \"amplitude\") is higher than would be expected under the null-hypothesis. Basically, because we investigated *per voxel* whether its value is higher than expected, we are making inferences on the level of voxels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of inference is *cluster*-level inference, in which you do not test the voxel amplitude, but the *size of clusters*. Basically, in this type of cluster-extent testing, you are investigating whether the size of the clusters you find are (significantly) larger than to be expected under the null-hypothesis (i.e., no effect). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as you can imagine, the null-distribution of cluster sizes (i.e. the size of \"significant\" clusters you'd expect by chance alone) depends strongly on the initial smoothness of your data. Again: RFT to the rescue! \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, RFT can *also* give us the $p$-value for clusters, given their size, by estimating the null-distribution of cluster-sizes based on the data's smoothness. So, instead of giving us the $p$-value for voxels based on the height of their value and the data's smoothness (i.e., voxel-level RFT), RFT can also do this on the *cluster-level* by investigating the $p$-value of the size of clusters. See how these two RFT-methods relate to each other? They're doing the same thing &mdash; estimating a null-distribution given the smoothness of the data &mdash; but for different things: either for the *height* of the ($z$-)statistic value per voxel (voxel-level RFT) or for the *size* per cluster (cluster-level RFT). \n",
    "\n",
    "How RFT does this is way beyond the scope of this course, but we'll walk you through it conceptually, so that you understand the implications of this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, a first step in cluster-level RFT is to determine a minimum (cutoff) value for your statistics map, which you can use to evaluate whether there are actually clusters in your data. Let's look at an example, in which we use a minimum value of 3.0:"
