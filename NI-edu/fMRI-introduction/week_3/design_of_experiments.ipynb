    "Experimental designs for fMRI studies come in different flavors, depending on what hypotheses you have about the phenomenon of interest and how you manipulate this. Apart from the different types of experimental designs (e.g., subtractive, factorial, parametric), there are a couple of general recommendations w.r.t. experimental design that can optimize the chance of finding positive results, which will be discussed in this notebook as well. These recommendations have to do with the specific ordering and timing of the events in your experiment. For example, suppose you show images of cats (condition: \"C\") and dogs (condition: \"D\") to subjects in the scanner, and you're interested if the brain responds differently to images of dogs compared to images of cats. What ordering (\"CCCCDDDD\" or \"CDCDCDCD\" or \"CCDCDDCD\"?) and timing (how long should I wait to present another stimulus?) of the stimuli will yield the best (here: highest) effect possible, and why? \n",

    "So far, we have discussed only designs with conditions that are categorical, such as \"male vs. female faces\"  and \"circles vs. squares\". The independent variables in your experimental design, however, do not *have* to be categorical! They can be continuous or ordinal, meaning that a particular variable might have different values (or \"weights\") across trials. Designs involving continuously varying properties are often called *parametric designs* or *parametric modulation*.\n",

    "In parametric designs, we assume that our design affects the voxel response in two ways:\n",
    "1. An \"unmodulated\" response (a response to the stimulus/task *independent* of parametric value);\n",
    "2. A parametric modulation of the response\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this more tangible, let's consider an example. Suppose that we have fMRI data from a reward-study. On every trial in this experiment, trials would start with a word \"guess\" on the screen for 1 second. Then, participants had to guess a number between 1 and 10 (which they indicated using an MRI-compatible button box). Before the experiment started, participants were told that the closer they were to the \"correct\" number (which was predetermined by the experimenter for every trial), the larger the reward they would get: 1 euro when their guess was correct and 10 cents less for every number that they were off (e.g., when the \"correct\" number was 7 and they would guess 5, then they'd receive 80 eurocents). After the participant's response and a inter-stimulus interval of 4 seconds, participants would see the amount they won on the screen.\n",

Before we go on, let's create some (hypothetical) experimental data. Suppose that the experiment lasted 10 minutes and contained 30 trials with varying reward magnitude, and fMRI was acquired with a TR of 1 second and onsets of the reward presentations were synchronized with the TR (again, while this is not very realistic, this obviates the need for up/downsampling)."

    "Alright, hopefully you now know how to design contrasts for factorial and parameteric designs! This section has a slightly different focus, namely the mathematics behind design variance and efficiency! Remember that we wouldn't tell you what \"design variance\" was last week? Well, this week we're going to discuss and explain it *extensively*! Before we delve into this topic, let's first recap the (conceptual) formula for the *t*-value from last week (the relevance of this will become clear shortly).\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you learned about the GLM and how to apply it to fMRI data to find out how much influence each predictor in your design has on the signal of a voxel. Crucially, you learned that you shouldn't look at raw beta-parameters to infer the effect of predictors, but that you should look at *normalized beta-parameters* &mdash; the **_t_-value**. Remember the formula for the *t*-value for a given contrast ($c$)?\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the *t*-value embodies the concept that the statistics you (should) care about, *t*-values, depend both on the **effect** (sometimes confusingly called the \"signal\"; $\\hat{\\beta}$), the **noise** ($\\hat{\\sigma}^{2} = \\frac{SSE}{\\mathrm{DF}}$), and the **\"design variance\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to find optimal (i.e. largest) *t*-values, we should try to optimize both the effect of our predictors (i.e. the betas), try to minimize the errors ($\\hat{\\sigma}^2$), and try to minimize the design variance of our model. In this lab, we'll shortly discuss the \"effect\" component ($\\hat{\\beta}$) and thereafter we'll discuss in detail the \"design variance\" part. We won't discuss the \"noise\" part, as this will be the topic of next week (preprocessing)."

    "### Optimizing \"effects\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Psychological factors\n",
    "As discussed above, the \"effect\" part of the conceptual formula for the t-statistic refers to the $\\beta$-parameter in the statistical formula. It may sound weird to try to \"optimize\" your effect, because there is no way to magically acquire a better/stronger effect from your data, right? (Well, apart from using a better/stronger MRI-scanner.) Actually, don't forget that the effect you're measuring is coming from the brain of a *human* beings (your subjects)! There are real and important psychological influences that affect the strength of your signal, and thus influence eventually the size of your $\\beta$-parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what are these psychological influences? Well, think about inattention/boredom, anxiety, sleepiness (don't underestimate how many subjects fall asleep in the scanner!), and subjects not understanding your task. As an extreme example: suppose you're showing your subject some visual stimuli in order to measure the effect of some visual property (e.g., object color) in the visual cortex. Imagine that your subject finds the task so boring that he/she falls asleep; the $\\beta$-parameters in this scenario are going to be *much* lower than when the subject wouldn't have fallen asleep, of course! Sure, this is an extreme (but not uncommon!) example, but it shows the potential influence of psychological factors on the \"effect\" you're measuring in your data!\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, when designing an experiment, you want to continually ask yourself: \"Are subjects really doing/thinking the way I want them to?\", and consequently: \"Am I really measuring what I think I'm measuring?\" \n",
    "\n",
    "(The effect of psychological aspects on the measured effect is thoroughly explained in the video [Psychological principles in experimental design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwy2k8YQ-cM) from Tor Wager, which you can also find on Canvas.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design factors\n",
    "Apart from taking psychological factors into account when designing your experiment, there are also design-technical factors that influence the (potential) strength of your signal: using blocked designs. We will, however, discuss this topic in a later section, because you need a better understanding of another part of the conceptual *t*-value formula first: design variance."

    "### Optimizing design variance\n",
    "So, last week we talked quite a bit about this mysterious term \"design variance\" and we promised to discuss it the next week. That's exactly what we're going to do now. As we shortly explained last week, *design variance is the part of the standard error caused by the design-matrix ($X$)*. Importantly, design variance is closely related to the *efficiency* of the design matrix ($X$), i.e., efficiency is the inverse of design variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathrm{efficiency} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{design\\ variance}}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "This term, efficiency, will be important in the rest of this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "As these terms are inversely related, high design variance means low efficiency (which we don't want) and low design variance means high efficiency (which we want). Phrased differently, high design variance means that your design-matrix is (relatively) *inefficient* for our goal to measure significant effects (i.e., high *t*-values). But, as you might have noticed, this definition is kind of circular. What causes low design variance (high efficiency), or: what constitutes an efficient design?\n",
    "\n",
    "Basicially, two factors contribute to an efficient design:\n",
    "1. The predictors in your design should have **high variance** (i.e. they should vary a lot relative to their mean)\n",
    "2. The predictors should **not** have **high covariance** (i.e. they should not correlate between each other a lot)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for any **contrast between two $\\beta$-parameters corresponding to predictor $j$ and $k$**, we can define their design variance as follows\\*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathrm{design\\ variance}_{j,k} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{var}[X_{j}] + \\mathrm{var}[X_{k}] - 2\\cdot \\mathrm{cov}[X_{j}, X_{k}]}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, design variance thus depends on the variance of the predictors *and* the covariance between predictors. Note that this formulation only applies to contrasts involving more than one parameter. For **contrasts against baseline, in which only one parameter is tested (e.g. predictor $j$)**, there is only one variance term (the other variance term and the covariance term are dropped out):\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",

    "It is of course kind of annoying to have two different definitions (and computations) of design variance, which depend on whether you want to test a parameter against baseline or against another parameter. Therefore, people usually use the vectorized computation (i.e. using matrix multiplication), which allows you to define the formula for design variance *for any contrast-vector $\\mathbf{c}$*:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathrm{design\\ variance} = \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{var}[X_{j}] + \\mathrm{var}[X_{k}] - 2\\cdot \\mathrm{cov}[X_{j}, X_{k}]} = \\mathbf{c}(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{c}^{T}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "While this notation, $\\mathbf{c}(\\mathbf{X}^{T}\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{c}$, may seem quite different than the above definitions using the $\\mathrm{var}$ and $\\mathrm{cov}$ terms, it is mathematically doing the same thing. The term $(X^{T}X)^{-1}$ represents (the inverse of) the variance-covariance matrix of the design ($X$) and **c** (contrast vector) is used only to \"extract\" the relevant variances and covariance for the particular contrast out of the entire covariance matrix of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "While appearing more complex, the advantage of the vectorized definition, however, is that it works for both contrasts against baseline (e.g. `[0, 0, 1]`) and contrasts between parameters (e.g. `[0, 1, -1]`). Now, if we plug in this mathematical definition of design variance in the formula of the standard error of a given contrast, we get:\n",

    "\n",
    "As you probably know, *variance* is a statistical property of a random variable that describes the average squared deviation from the variable's mean. Formally, for any variable $x$ with mean $\\bar{x}$ and length $N$, its sample variance is defined as:\n",

    "To demonstrate the effect of predictor variance on design variance/efficiency, we will focus (for simplicity) on non-time series designs that have just a single condition and thus a single predictor (apart from the intercept).

    "To start, we want to show you &mdash; conceptually &mdash; why it is important to have a lot of variance in your predictors for a low standard error of your beta, and thus high t-values. We're going to show you an example of 'regular' linear regression (so no time-series signal, but the example holds for MRI data).\n",

    "Specifically, the **higher** the covariance (multicollinearity), the **lower** the design efficiency (the worse our design is). Conceptually, you can think of high covariance between predictors as causing *uncertainty* of the estimation of your beta-estimates: if your predictors are correlated, the GLM \"doesn't know\" what (de)activation it should assign to which predictor. This uncertainty due to correlated predictors is reflected in a (relatively) higher design variance term.\n",

For example, you might be interested in the contrast of predictor \"A\" against baseline, predictor \"B\" against baseline, and the difference between predictor \"A\" and \"B\"\\*. We can simply extend our formula for efficiency to allow more than one contrast. For $K$ contrasts, efficiency is defined as:\n",

    "\n",
    "**1) You want to know whether different conditions activate voxel activity differently.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We've learned how to do this in week 2: essentially, you want to estimate just a beta-parameter (reflecting activation/deactivation) of your stimulus-regressors. This is a question about HRF-*amplitude* only. The far majority of fMRI research falls in this category (and it's the type we'll focus on in this course). It is often said that this type of research focuses on **detection** of a signal's response. For this question, designs are often based on canonical HRF-based convolution (or based on a basis set).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) You want investigate how different conditions influence voxel activity not only by investigating the \"amplitude\" parameter of the HRF, but also parameters relating to other properties of the shape of the HRF (like width, lag, strenght of undershoot, etc.).**\n",
    "\n",
    "A small proportion of fMRI studies have this goal. Examples are studies that investigate [how the shape of the HRF changes with age](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811907010877) or that investigate [differences in HRF shape across clinical populations](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811907001371). We won't focus on this type of research in this course, but you should know that you can also investigate other parameters of the HRF in neuroimaging research! It if often said that this type of research focuses on **estimation** of the (shape of the) signal's response. Often, \"finite impulse reponse\" (FIR) models are used for these types of studies (which you might have seen in the videos).\n",

    "### The \"paradox\" of efficiency\n",
    "So, we've discussed blocked and event-related designs and we've come to the conclusion that blocked designs are simply more efficient than event-related designs. \"So, we should always use blocked designs?\", you may ask. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, no.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed the mathematics behind design variance, efficiency, and t-value in detail, but we shouldn't forget that ultimately **we're measuring the data from a living human beings in the MRI-scanner**, who tend to get bored, fall asleep, and otherwise not pay attention if the task they're doing is monotonous, predictable or simply uninteresting!\n",
    "\n",
    "Blocked designs, however, are (usually) exactly this: designs that are experienced as predictable, monotonous, and (relatively) boring! Like we said earlier, the effects we're going to measure depend on three things - effects, noise, and design efficiency - and psychological factors may strongly influence the \"effect\" part and thus affect the statistics we're interested in (i.e., t-values). In addition to psychological factors like boredom and inattention, blocked designs may also lead to unwanted effects like habituation (attenuation of the BOLD-response after repeated stimulation), which violate the assumption of the BOLD-response as being 'linear time-invariant' (LTI). In other words, the BOLD-response may stop 'behaving' like we assume it behaves when we use blocked designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is, essentially, the paradox of designing fMRI experiments: the most efficient designs are also the designs that (potentially) lead to the lowest signal or otherwise unintended effects (due to boredom, predictability, habituation, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do we do in practice? Usually, we use (semi-random) event-related designs. We lose some efficiency by using event-related designs instead of blocked designs, but we reduce the chance of psychological factors and other effects that reduce the measured signal or mess with the assumption of linear time-invariance.\n",

    "Given that we're going to use some event-related (i.e., \"random\") design, let's investigate how we can optimize this type of design."

In general, jittering increases the number of different designs you can simulate relative to fixed-ISI designs. A great way to visualize this is to simply run the simulation of fixed-ISI and jittered-ISI designs a number of times and plot the resulting efficiencies in two separate histograms. You should see that the histogram of efficiencies from fixed-ISI designs is quite a bit narrower than the histogram of efficiencies from jittered-ISI designs (but you might also also see that some jittered-ISI designs are *less* efficient that the average fixed-ISI design).\n",

Then, plot in *a single plot*, the histogram (using <tt>plt.hist</tt>) of the fixed-ISI efficiencies and the histogram of the jittered-ISI efficiencies.

    "So, in this section we discussed how to structure your experiment such that it yields a (relatively) high design efficiency, which will optimize our chance to find significant effects. How you do this depends on whether you aim for estimation (what is the shape of the HRF?) or for detection (what is the amplitude of the response?). Usually, we aim for detection; in that case, designs can be roughly grouped in two types: blocked designs an event-related designs. Purely statistically speaking, blocked designs are (almost always) more efficient, because they generally have lower covariance and higher variance than event-related designs. However, due to psychological factors and potential violations of the linear time-invariance of the BOLD-response, we often opt for event-related designs in the end. For event-related designs, we can increase our chance of finding a relatively efficient design by jittering our ISIs."

    "In the previous assignment, you have seen that jittered-ISI designs display quite some variance in efficiency (ranging from approx. 2.3 tot 3.1). This shows you that there are very many different designs possible, even with only two conditions, each associated with its own efficiency. Ideally, we want the **best** design (i.e., most efficient) out of all the possible designs. This is, however, for many (slightly more complex) designs not possible, because you would need to simulate billions of designs to exhaustively test them all! Moreover, we have also seen that high statistical efficiency (long blocked designs) may also have unwanted psychological effects (predictability, boredom).\n",

    "    Before handing in your notebooks, we recommend restarting your kernel (Kernel: Restart & Clear Ouput) and running all your cells again (manually, or by Cell: Run all). By running all your cells one by one (from \"top\" to \"bottom\" of the notebook), you may spot potential errors that are caused by accidentally overwriting your variables or running your cells out of order (e.g., defining the variable 'x' in cell 28 which you then use in cell 15). If you fix this before handing in your notebook, you prevent your ToDos from being graded as incorrect due to these unfortunate errors (because we grade your notebook from \"top\" to \"bottom\" as well).\n",
