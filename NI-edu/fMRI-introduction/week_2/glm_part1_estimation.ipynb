    "# The GLM, part 1: estimation\n",
    "This week will be all about how most univariate fMRI analyses are done: using the **GLM**. Specifically, we'll focus on the \"estimation\" part of the GLM (i.e., how do we estimate parameters?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The GLM, or the General Linear Model, is a statistical model that underlies a range of statistical models that you're probably already familiar with: (M)ANOVA, *t*-test, *F*-test, and most importantly ordinary *linear regression*. Mathematically, all these different tests are specific instantiations of the GLM (check [this blog post](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/) if you want to know more about this equivalence).\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, the type of fMRI analysis you are going to learn in this course (often called 'univariate analysis' or 'Statistical Parametric Mapping') is just an linear regression model applied to time-series data. Given that you have some basic familiarity with these concepts (we which recap in section 1), you will see during this tutorial that univariate fMRI analyses using the GLM are actually very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of the importance of the GLM, this week's lab is probably going to take quite long again. So, you'll have to work hard this week, but it'll definitely pay off. Also, the material will seem quite mathematical, but it often serves a symbolic purpose: to show you how results are influenced by different parts of the formulas within the GLM. Moreover, after showing and explaining you the formulas, we'll work it out in code examples (which are often easier to understand!). Also, after explaining a certain aspect of the GLM, we'll ask you to think about it and practice with it in ToThink and ToDo questions (like last week).\n",

    "## Recap of linear regression\n",
    "To refresh your memory on linear regression, we'll walk you through a recap of the technique's most important concepts.\n",
    "We are going to work through a simple example. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, `y` will denote our *dependent variable* (the variable we try to model/explain) and `X` will denote our *independent variable(s)* (the variables we're using to try to explain `y`). Throughout the entire tutorial will use `X` to refer to our matrix of independent variables (also called \"predictors\" or \"regressors\", or simply \"design matrix\") and use `y` to refer to our dependent variable (also sometimes called \"target\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the independent variables are often grouped in a single matrix (a 2D array) &mdash; which is sometimes called the \"design matrix\" (because it 'designs' the way we want to model our dependent variable). As stated before, in this tutorial we store our design matrix - the set of our independent variables - in the variable `X` (or slight variations on that, like `X_new` or something). Importantly, it is often assumed (e.g. by statistics functions/software) that the design matrix takes the shape of $N\\ \\mathrm{(observations)} \\times P\\ \\mathrm{(predictors)}$. So, the rows refer to the sampled observations (also often called \"samples\", \"instances\", or simply \"data points\"). The columns refer to the separate independent variables that we use to model the dependent variable. For the dependent variable, it is often assumed that this is a single row-vector of shape $N \\times 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notation\n",
    "Next, let's define some more conventions in notation. We will denote the total number of observations with **$N$**. Moreover, we'll denote **$i$** as the index of samples. To give an example, the formula below gives you the sum of our target variable:\n",

    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathrm{sum}(\\mathbf{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_{i} \n",
    "\\end{align}\n",

    "Lastly, we denote the total number of predictors **$P$** and  **$j$** as the index of our predictors. So, for example, if we wanted to sum over our predictors for a given sample **$i$**, we'd write: \n",
    "\n",

    "As you can see, there seems to be some positive linear relationship between $X$ (just the independent variable without the intercept) and $y$. In other words, an increase in $X$ will lead to an increase in $y$. But, at this moment, *how much exactly* $y$ changes for a increase in $X$ is unknown. By doing a linear regression with $X$ as our predictor of $y$, we can quantify this! \n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter, i.e. the \"thing\" that quantifies the influence of $X$ on $y$, calculated by this model is often called the **beta-parameter(s)** (but sometimes they're denoted as theta, or any other greek symbol/letter). The beta-parameter quantifies exactly how much $y$ changes if you increase $X$ by 1. Or, in other words, it quantifies how much influence $X$ has on $y$. In a formula ($\\delta$ stands for \"change in\")\\*: \n",

    "As you probably realize, each predictor in $X$ (i.e., $X_{j}$) has a parameter ($\\beta_{j}$) that quantifies how much influence that predictor has on our target variable ($y$). This includes the intercept, our vector of ones (which is in textbooks often denoted by $\\beta_{0}$; they often don't write out $\\beta_{0}X_{0}$ because, if a vector of ones is used, $\\beta_{0}\\cdot 1$ simplifies to $\\beta_{0}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, linear regression describes a model in which a set of beta-parameters are calculated to characterize the influence of each predictor in $X$ on $y$, that together explain $y$ as well as possible (but the model is usually not perfect, so there will be some *error*, or \"unexplained variance\", denoted by $\\epsilon$). As such, we can formulate the linear regression model as follows:\n",

In other words, our predictors are just other variables that you measured in your study. \n",

    "#### The canonical HRF\n",
    "The easiest and most often-used approach to incorporating knowledge about the BOLD-response in univariate analyses of fMRI data is to assume that each voxel responds to a stimulus in a fixed way. In other words, that voxels always respond (activate/deactivate) to a stimulus in the same manner. This is known as using a \"canonical haemodynamic response function (HRF)\". Basically, an HRF is a formalization of how we think the a voxel is going to respond to a stimulus. A *canonical* HRF is the implementation of an HRF in which you use the same HRF for each voxel, participant, and condition. There are other implementations of HRFs (apart from the canonical), in which you can adjust the exact shape of the HRF based on the data you have; examples of these HRFs are *temporal basis sets* and *finite impulse reponse models* (FIR), which we'll discuss later.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different types of (canonical) HRFs; each models the assumed shape of the BOLD-response slightly differently. For this course, we'll use the most often used canonical HRF: the double-gamma HRF, which is a combination of two different gamma functions (one modelling the overshoot and one modelling the post-stimulus undershoot).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the \"double gamma\" HRF implementation of the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io) Python package. They provide different \"versions\" of the HRF (which differ slightly in their shape); we'll use the \"Glover\" version, which is based on a double-[gamma function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function): `glover_hrf`."

Very often, however, stimuli (or whatever you're using to construct your predictors) are not locked to \"round\" seconds. How would you then initially create a predictor? One way is to do so is to create your stimulus predictor on a more precise timescale, such as on hundredths of seconds (i.e., with a precision of 0.01 seconds). In other words, we oversample the predictor with a factor 100. Then, we can set the indices in this oversampled predictor to our onsets with a higher precision (e.g., for a particular onset at 5.12 seconds, we can set the predictor at index 512 to 1).\n",

This is quite a strong assumption. In fact, studies have shown that the exact shape of the HRF often differs between voxels, conditions, and subjects (as is explained in detail by the [video on basis sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfeMIcDWwko&index=21&list=PLcvMDPDk-dSmTBejANv7kY2mFo1ni_gkA) by Tor Wager).\n",

The function <tt>black_box</tt> takes three inputs: <tt>x1</tt>, <tt>x2</tt>, and <tt>x3</tt>. The function outputs a (deterministic) value for $y$. So, you could use (\"query\") the function like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<tt>y_output = black_box(x1=10, x2=5, x3=2)</tt>\n",

    "Now, your assignment is to, experimentally, figure out (\"reverse engineer\") the model's parameters $\\beta_{0}$, $\\beta_{1}$, $\\beta_{2}$, and $\\beta_{3}$. In other words, run the function with some inputs values and check the corresponding outputs. From those combinations of inputs and outputs, you can reconstruct the four different parameters. Once you figure out these betas, store them in the variables <tt>beta_0</tt>, <tt>beta_1</tt>, <tt>beta_2</tt>, and <tt>beta_3</tt>.\n",
