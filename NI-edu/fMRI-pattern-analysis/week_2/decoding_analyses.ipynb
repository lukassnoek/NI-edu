    "# Machine learning (\"decoding\") analyses\n",
    "This week's tutorial is about how to implement \"decoding\" analyses in Python! \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"decoding\" is often used to denote analyses that aim to predict a single experimental feature (which can be either within-subject or between-subject) based on patterns of neuroimaging data. Some more advanced techniques make it possible to predict more than one experimental feature at once (with [Bayesian \"reconstruction\" techniques](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309006850) and [\"inverted encoding models\"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315006352)), but these are beyond the scope of this course. Here, we'll focus on machine learning/statistical models and techniques that allow you to predict a single experimental feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll make heavy use of the awesome [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) library &mdash; the go-to library for machine learning in Python. \n",

    "## Data representation\n",
    "Decoding analyses always need two sets of data: the brain patterns, which we'll refer to as $\\mathbf{R}$ (for **R**esponse), and a single experimental feature that we want to predict, which we'll refer to as $\\mathbf{S}$ (which traditionally refers to **S**timulus). Note that $\\mathbf{s}$ could be a within-subject experimental factor (such as stimulus or response-related factors) or a between-subject variable (such as age or depressed vs. healthy control). Moreover, the to-be-predicted variable\\* can be either continuous (e.g., reaction time) or categorical (e.g., object category), which are associated with different types of models, regression and classification models respectively (more about this later). Note that \"direction\" of analysis is the exact opposite of what is done in enconding analyses. In encoding analyses, we try to predict the brain data (dependent variable) using experimental features (independent variables), while in decoding analyses we try to predict an experimental feature (dependent variable) using a a set of brain patterns (independent variables)! But essentially, encoding and decoding models are mathematically the same (they just use different inputs). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this lab, we'll work with simulated data. For now, we'll assume that our data is from a simple face perception experiment in which participants viewed images with either male (condition: \"M\") or female faces (condition: \"F\") across four different fMRI runs. So, our experimental feature of interest is a categorical variable with two levels (\"M\" and \"F\"), making this a classification analysis (which is more common than regression in the context of cognitive neuroscience). Each run, participants saw fourty images (twenty for each condition) presented in a random order. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll simulate the patterns ($\\mathbf{R}$) and experimental feature ($\\mathbf{S}$, \"M\" vs. \"F\") below. For now, we'll generate random data (with some autocorrelation), for reasons that will become clear later. We'll assume that we are restricting our analysis to a single region-of-interest containing a 1000 voxels.\n",

    "In addition to the \"preprocessing\" steps for pattern analyses discussed in last week's lab, when doing decoding, you additionally need to standardize your brain features (i.e., the columns in your pattern matrix) on which you fit your model. With \"standardization\", we mean making sure each feature ($\\mathbf{R}_{j}$ for column $j$) in your pattern matrix has 0 zero mean and unit (1) standard deviation, which can be achieved as follows for each feature $j$:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\bar{\\mathbf{R}_{j}}$ represents the *mean* of $\\mathbf{R}_{j}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{R}_{j})$ represents the standard deviation of $\\mathbf{R}_{j}$. In other words, for each value in $\\mathbf{R}$, you subtract the mean from the column it belongs to and subsequently you divide the result by the standard deviation of the column it belongs to. This process is also known as *z-scoring*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This standardization process is done for each brain feature (column) separately. Standardization is important for most ML/statistical models because it makes sure that each brain feature has the same *scale*, which often helps in efficiently estimating model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, when you have patterns from multiple runs (as is often the case in fMRI decoding), these patterns should also be independently standardized, even if you want to pool these patterns later on (see [Lee & Kable, 2018](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0207083)). This is because some runs may yield patterns with a relatively higher mean or standard deviation across samples (for example, because participants start moving more towards the end of the experiment, leading to more noisy pattern estimates)."

While this is common practice in many statistical models in psychology and neuroscience (including standard univariate \"activation-based\" fMRI models), this is not advisable for decoding models. The reason for this is that our decoding models often have many more predictors (i.e., brain features) than observations (i.e., trials). The consequence is that the model has a hard time figuring out what is \"signal\" and what is \"noise\", which will often cause your model to capitalize on spurious correlations between your data ($\\mathbf{R}$) and the target ($\\mathbf{S}$). The result is that your model will be *overfitted* and your model performance estimate will be overly optimistic estimate of generalization performance.\n",

    "To obtain an unbiased (that is, not overly optimistic) estimate of generalization performance, machine-learning based analyses often perform *cross-validation*. Cross-validation is, in it's broadest definition, the process of estimating analysis parameters on a different subset of your data than the data you want to generate predictions for (and thus base generalization performance on). With \"analysis parameters\", we do not only mean the parameters of your statistical model ($\\hat{\\beta}$), but this may also involve parameters estimated during preprocessing and feature transformations (which we'll talk about later). Importantly, cross-validation (if done properly) allows you to derive an unbiased estimate of generalization performance, i.e., how well your analysis would generalize to a new dataset. Importantly, cross-validation _does not solve overfitting_; it only _detects_ overfitting. To prevent overfitting, you can employ regularization or feature selection/extraction techniques, of which the latter is briefly discussed in this tutorial."

However, if you have a relatively small dataset, you will probably have a relatively small test-set. If you then estimate cross-validated accuracy on this test-set, the chance of just getting a relatively good (or bad) score by coincidence is quite high (see e.g. [Varoquaux et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191630595X#s0055))!

    "Before moving on to more exciting aspects of decoding pipelines, let's discuss class imbalance. Class imbalance, the situation in which not all classes within your target variable have the same number of samples, can have a big impact on your classification model (note: this is not relevant for regression models, as they don't have *classes*!). This is not uncommon in decoding models, especially when you don't have control over the feature of interest, such as response-based features (e.g., whether the participant pressed left or right) or between-subjects variables (e.g., when dealing with clinical populations, which cannot always be perfectly balanced due to practical reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate this, let's look at what happens with random data and a imbalanced target variable. We'll simulate some random data (like our previously used data, this contains no \"signal\" at all: you'd expect 50% accuracy) a couple of times and we'll calculate the cross-validated accuracy."

In our previous examples which used completely random (null) data, this is not a problem, but it *is* a problem when the data actually contains some effect. One way to counter this is by using the `class_weight` parameter that is available in mode scikit-learn models. Setting the parameter to \"balanced\" will weigh samples from the minority class more strongly than samples from the majority class, forcing the model to learn information that is independent from class frequency.

    "### Searchlight analysis\n",
    "One last technique that we want to discuss before moving on to statistical testing of decoding results is *searchlight analysis* (although it's not *really* a feature selection/extraction technique). [Searchlight analysis](https://www.pnas.org/content/103/10/3863.short) is a decoding-based analysis that is kind of a hybrid between univariate and multivariate analysis: it analyzes local voxel *patterns* but does that for every location in the brain. It does so by defining a spherical \"searchlight\" of voxels around a particular center voxel (with a particular radius). Within this searchlight, a (cross-validated) decoding analysis is performed and the result, usually a foldwise average model performance score (e.g., accuracy), is assigned to the center voxel. Then, the searchlight moved to the next voxel and a new decoding analysis performed; this process is repeated until each voxel has been the center voxel (and has been assigned a model performance score). As such, at the end of the searchlight analysis, you have an entire volume of (average) model performances, not just a single one!\n",

This is like testing commute time of people against a null-hypothesis of 0, which doesn't make sense, because you cannot have a negative commute time! Allefeld and colleagues propose a solution, which they call \"prevalence inference\", which involves intricate permutation testing procedures and is a bit too complicated for this course.

The null-distribution refers to the distribution of classification accuracies that would arise if you would repeat an experiment with noisy data in which there is no effect (i.e. the null-hypothesis is true). \n",

    "Thus, we need to somehow repeat the above \"experiment\" (i.e. the analysis which yielded the observed performance of 51.1%) yet while the null-hypothesis is true (i.e. there is no effect, only noise). Well, as the term \"permutation\" suggest, we can simply randomly shuffly the train-labels (`S_train`) to generate random labels. Now, if we would fit the classifier on {`R_train`, and `S_train`}, then practically it would fit on noise. In fact, by random shuffling of the train-labels, we simulated the scenario in which (on average) the null-hypothesis would be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what we need to do in order to create a null-distribution of classification-accuracies is to run our original analysis (in the code cell above) many times (i.e. \"repeat the experiment\"), yet with random labeling of our train-samples. We expect that the mean of these null-accuracies would center around .5 (assumed chance level), but simply due to random noise, our simulated null-distribution will contain values (sometimes substantially) above and below chance level. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, look at the code-cell below. It contains exactly the same analysis as in the above code-block, yet now it is looped 100 times, and just before fitting (within every fold separately) we shuffle the train-labels to generate a random mapping between `R_train` and `S_train`. After every \"experiment\" (or simply \"permutation\") we average the permuted accuracy scores across folds and store them (in the variable `permuted_accuracies`). Now, let's run the code cell below (may take minute or two):"

For the patterns, you can reuse the <tt>R_4D</tt> variable. However, you need to index this with a \"Frontal Orbital Cortex\" ROI from the Harvard-Oxford atlas (also defined below: <tt>ho_atlas</tt>). Note, you have to define the ROI yourself (including resampling to match the resolution of the patterns). <br><br>Then, construct a pipeline with a <tt>StandardScaler</tt> and a <tt>Ridge</tt> regression model (from the <tt>linear_model</tt> module; do not use any specific arguments during initialization). Using a 4-fold cross-validation routine (using the <tt>KFold</tt> class from the <tt>model_selection</tt> module), compute the cross-validated mean squared error (either manually or using the <tt>mean_squared_error</tt> function from the <tt>metrics</tt> module) each iteration.
