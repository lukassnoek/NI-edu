    "# An introduction to Nilearn\n",
    "This notebook is about the amazing [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) Python package for applying statistical learning techniques (from GLMs to multivariate \"decoding\" and connectivity techniques) to neuroimaging data. In addition, it features all kinds of neat functionality like automic fetching of publicly available data, (interactive) visualization of brain images, and easy image operations.\n",

Notably, this notebook contains several exercises (which we call \"ToDos\"), which are meant to make this tutorial more interactive! Also, this tutorial is merely an introduction to (parts of) the Nilearn package. We strongly recommend checking out the excellent [user guide](https://nilearn.github.io/user_guide.html) and [example gallery](https://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/index.html) on the Nilearn website if you want to delve deeper into the package's (more advanced) features.\n",

    "We covered quite some functionality from the Nilearn package, but definitely not all! It als contains some useful features for \"decoding\" analyses (in the [decoding](https://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.decoding) module, including a class to perform [Searchlight]()-based analysis and several classifiers for spatially-structured data such as fMRI data) amongst other things.\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend you browse through the ample excellent tutorials and examples on the Nilearn [website](https://nilearn.github.io/), which cover other and more advanced usecases than discussed in this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "That said, we hope that this tutorial helps you to get started with your analyses using Nilearn.<br>\n",
    "Happy hacking!"
