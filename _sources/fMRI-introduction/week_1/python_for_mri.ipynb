    "## What is \"nifti\"?\n",
    "Usually, every scanner manufacturer (Philips, Siemens, GE, etc.) have their own proprietary data format. For example, here at the University of Amsterdam, we have a Philips scanner and we often export our data as PAR/REC files. However, to streamline the development and use of neuroimaging software packages, the Neuroimaging InFormatics Technology Initiative came up with a new, standardized format, *nifti*, that most neuroimaging packages should support. As such, usually the first step in any (f)MRI preprocessing pipeline is to convert the scanner-specific files (e.g., PAR/RECs) to nifti. This is beyond the scope of this course, but if at one point you need to do this yourself, we highly recommed the [dcm2niix](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix) package!\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout these tutorials you'll work with these nifti-files (also called nifti images), which you can recognize by their extension of *.nii* or its compressed version *.nii.gz*. This file-format is supported by most neuroimaging software packages (such as FSL, which you'll use later in this course!). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we'd like to inspect and analyze nifti images in Python as well! *Nibabel* is an awesome Python package that allows us to read and load nifti images, and convert them to numpy arrays in a straightforward manner."

As such, we need a way to tell what is left and right (and anterior/posterior and inferior/superior) in our voxel space - this is what the affine is for! It will tell us, basically, whether \"left\" in our \"voxel space\" is also \"left\" in the \"real world\".\n",

Furthermore, nibabel `Nifti1Images` assume that the first axis goes from left to right, the second axis goes posterior to anterior, and the third axis from inferior to superior. A short-hand for this convention is *RAS+*, which basically says that coordinates to the Right, Anterior, and Superior of the isocenter should be positive (+). It follows that coordinates to the left, posterior, and inferior of the isocenter should be negative (-).\n",
