    "## Introduction\n",
    "From your statistics classes, you might remember that many software packages (e.g. SPSS, R, SAS) do not only return beta-parameters of linear regression models, but also *t*-values and *p*-values associated with those parameters. These statistics evaluate whether a beta-parameter (or combination of beta-parameters) differs significantly from 0 (or in fMRI terms: whether a voxel activates/deactivates significantly in response to one or more experimental factors).\n",

    "In univariate (activation-based) fMRI studies, we need statistics to evaluate the estimated parameters in context of the *uncertainty* of their estimation. As we'll discuss later in more detail, interpreting (and performing inference about) the magnitude of GLM parameters without their associated uncertainty is rarely warranted in univariate fMRI studies. To illustrate the problem with this, let's look at an example.\n",

    "## How to compute *t*-values and *p*-values\n",
    "So, you've seen that interpreting beta-parameters by themselves is useless because their value depends very much on the scale of your variables. But how should we, then, interpret the effects of our predictors on our target-variable? From the plots above, you probably guessed already that it has something to do with the MSE of our model (or, more generally, the model fit). That is indeed the case. As you might have noticed, not only the beta-parameters depend on the scale of your data, the errors (residuals) depend on the scale as well. In other words, not only the *effect* (beta-values) but also the *noise* (errors, MSE) depend on the scale of the variables! \n",
    "\n",
    "### *t*-values\n",
    "In fact, the key to getting interpretable effects of our predictors is to divide (\"normalize\") our beta-parameter(s) by some quantity that summarizes how well our model describes the data. This quantity is the **standard error of the beta-parameter**, usually denoted by $\\mathrm{SE}_{\\beta}$. The standard error of the beta-parameter can be computed by taking the square root of the **variance of the beta-parameter**. If we'd divide our beta-estimate with it's standard error, we compute a statistic you are all familiar with: the *t*-statistic! Formally:\n",

    "Another way to think about it is that the t-value is the \"effect\" ($\\hat{\\beta}$) divided by your (un)certainty or confidence in the effect ($\\mathrm{SE}_{\\hat{\\beta}}$). In a way, you can think of t-values as \"uncertainty-normalized\" effects.\n",
    "\n",

In this lab, we won't explain what *design variance* means or how to compute this, as this is the topic of the second notebook of this week (`design_of_experiments`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we treat \"design variance\", here, as some known (constant) value given the design matrix ($\\mathbf{X}$). So, with this information, we can construct a conceptual formula for the standard error of our parameter(s):\n",

    "**This (conceptual) formula involving effects, noise, and design variance is probably the most important concept of this course**. The effects (*t*-values) we measure in GLM analyses of fMRI data depend on two things: the effect measured ($\\hat{\\beta}$) and the (un)certainty of the effect ($SE_{\\hat{\\beta}}$), of which the latter term can be divided into the unexplained variance (\"noise\") and the design variance (uncertainty of the parameter due to the design).\n",

    "We're almost done! We're really at 99% of what you should know about the GLM and fMRI analysis (except for some important caveats that have to do with GLM assumptions, that we'll discuss next week). The only major concept that we need to discuss is **contrasts**. Contrasts are basically follow-up statistical tests of GLM parameters, with which you can implement any (linear) statistical test that you are familiar with. *t*-tests, *F*-tests, ANCOVAs &mdash; they can all be realized with the GLM and the right contrast(s). (Again, if you want to know more about this equivalence between the GLM and common statistical tests, check out this [blog post](https://lindeloev.github.io/tests-as-linear/).) Importantly, the choice of contrast should reflect the hypothesis that you want to test.\n",

    "* $H_{0}: \\beta = 0$        (our null-hypothesis, i.e. no effect)\n",
    "* $H_{a}: \\beta \\neq 0$     (our two-sided alternative hypothesis, i.e. *some* effect)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a directional alternative hypothesis is also possible, i.e., $H_{a}: \\beta > 0$ or $H_{a}: \\beta < 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Using a contrast between parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of contrast basically tests hypotheses such as \"Does predictor 1 have a larger effect on my dependent variable than predictor 2?\". In other words, it tests the following hypothesis:\n",
    "* $H_{0}: \\beta_{1} - \\beta_{2} = 0$ (our null-hypothesis, i.e. there is no difference)\n",
    "* $H_{a}: \\beta_{1} - \\beta_{2} \\neq 0$     (our alternative hypothesis, i.e. there is some difference)\n",

    "In the previous section we discussed how to calculate *t*-values for single contrasts. However, sometimes you might have a hypothesis about multiple contrasts at the same time. This may sound weird, but let's consider an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have data from an experiment in which you showed images of circles which were either blue, red, or green. In that case, you have three predictors. Then, you could have very specific question, like \"Do blue circles activate a voxel significantly compared to baseline\", which corresponds to the following null and alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_{0}: \\beta_{blue} = 0$ (our null-hypothesis, i.e. there is no activation compared to baseline)\n",
    "* $H_{a}: \\beta_{blue} > 0$   (our alternative hypothesis, i.e. blue activates relative to baseline)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you can also have a more general question, like \"Does the presentation of *any* circle (regardless of color) activate a voxel compared to baseline?\". This question represents the following null and alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $H_{0}: \\beta_{blue} = \\beta_{red} = \\beta_{green} = 0$\n",
    "* $H_{a}: (\\beta_{blue} > 0) \\vee (\\beta_{red} > 0) \\vee (\\beta_{green} > 0)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\vee$ symbol in the alternative hypothesis means \"or\". So the alternative hypothesis nicely illustrates our question: is there *any* condition (circle) that activates a voxel more than baseline? This hypothesis-test might sound familiar, because it encompasses the *F*-test! In other words, an *F*-test tests *a collection of contrasts* together. In the example here, the *F*-test tests the following contrasts together (ignoring the intercept) of our beta-parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `[1, 0, 0]` ($\\mathrm{red} > 0$)\n",

Well, yeah, regular univariate analyses as you might read about in scientific journals do basically what you've just learned, but then not on a single voxel, but on each voxel in the brain separately. Basically just a gigantic for-loop across voxels in which everytime the same design ($\\mathbf{X}$) is used to predict a new voxel-signal ($\\mathbf{y}$). Afterwards, the *t*-values of the contrast (hypothesis) you're interested in are plotted back onto a brain, color-code it (high t-values yellow, low t-values red), and voilà, you have your pretty brain plot."
