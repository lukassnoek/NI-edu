The next notebook, `run_level_analysis.ipynb`, will continue with run-level analysis, and next week we will conclude this topic with group-level analyses. If you haven't done so already, please go throught `linux_and_the_command_line` notebook first!\n",

Note that there are several other excellent neuroimaging software packages, such as [SPM](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) (Matlab-based), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/), [BROCCOLI](https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI), [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/), and [Nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/).

    "In the previous notebook about Linux and the command line, we discussed how to use built-in Linux commands and FSL-specific commands using the command line. Now, let's focus on using a specific FSL tool called \"FSLeyes\", which is a useful program to view (f)MRI files (basically any nifti-file). We can start this graphical tool from the command line with the command: `fsleyes &`. We append the `&` to the FSLeyes command because this makes sure FSLeyes will run \"in the background\" and thus allows us to keep using the command line (if we would not use the `&`, FSLeyes would run be active \"in your terminal\", and we wouldn't be able to use that anymore).

The NI-edu study has been specifically \"designed\" for this (and the follow-up \"pattern analysis\") course. The experimental paradigms used for this dataset are meant to investigate how the brain processes information from faces and the representation of their subjective impressions (e.g., their perceived attractiveness, dominance, and trustworthiness). In addition to tasks that investigate face processing specifically, the dataset also includes several runs with a \"functional localizer\" task, which can be used to identify regions that preferentially respond to a particular object category (like faces, bodies, characters, etc.). In this course, we'll mostly use the localizer data, because the associated task (design) is relativelly simple and generates a robust signal.\n",

    "Most univariate fMRI studies contain data from a sample of multiple individuals. Often, the goal of these studies is to (1) *estimate* some effect (e.g., $\\beta_{face} >0$) at the group-level, i.e., whether the effect is present within our sample, and subsequently, taking into account the variance (uncertainty) of this group-level effect, (2) to *infer* whether this effect is likely to be true in the broader population (but beware of the tricky interpretation of [null-hypothesis significance tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Criticism)).\n",

    "\n",
    "Often, people use so called \"mixed models\" (or \"multilevel models\") to deal with this kind of hierarchical data. These type of models use the GLM framework for estimating effects, but have a special way of estimating the variance of effects (i.e., $\\mathrm{var}[c\\hat{\\beta}]$), which includes variance estimates from all levels within the model (subject-level, run-level, and group-level). In these mixed models, you can simply put all your data ($y$ and $\\mathbf{X}$) from different runs, sessions, and subjects, in a single GLM and estimate the effects of interest (and their variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, this \"traditional\" multilevel approach is not feasible for most univariate (whole-brain) analyses, because these models are quite computationally expensive (i.e., they take a long time to run), so doing this for all > 200,000 voxels is the brain is not very practical. Fortunately, the fMRI community came up with a solution: the \"summary statistics\" approach, which approximates a proper full multilevel model.\n",

Real EVs are the original EVs + the extra predictors that are generated due to the specific HRF-model. For example, if you'd choose a gamma basis set instead of a double-gamma HRF, the original canonical HRF of each predictor would be \"Original EVs\" while *all* predictors making up the HRF-components (canonical and temporal and dispersion derivatives) would be the \"Real EVs\".

To create F-tests, set the number of F-tests that you want to do (i.e., increase the number next to the \"F-tests\" field), and check, per F-test, which contrasts to want to include in them.

But using a p-value threshold of 0.05 \"uncorrected\" (which means: not corrected for multiple comparisons &mdash; a topic we'll discuss next week!) is usually used to detect any potential problems during the experimental, preprocessing, and analysis process. For example, if we don't see significant visual cortex activation in response to a task with visual stimuli at $p < 0.05$ (uncorrected), then it is very likely that something went wrong somewhere in the preprocessing/analysis pipeline (e.g., stimulus onsets are incorrect).

    "Many voxels throughout the brain seem to specifically activate in response to images of faces (but beware: these brain images are not yet \"properly\" thresholded, so many of these voxels might actually be false positives, but that's the topic of next week!). Two cluster of voxels, however, seem especially strongly activated: one centered at $[24, 19, 21]$ and another one centered at $[23, 30, 13]$. Note that these clusters are present in both hemispheres, but the cluster in the right hemisphere is clearly more strongly activated, which is consistent with the apparent right-hemisphere bias in face processing (see e.g., [Kanwisher et al., 1997](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/17/11/4302)).\n"
