    "# Statistics with Nilearn\n",
    "This notebook is about the GLM/statistics-related functionality of the [nilearn](https://nilearn.github.io/) Python package for statistical analysis of fMRI data. While it is still in development, it promises to become a full-fledged Python-based alternative to existing (f)MRI analysis software packages such as FSL, SPM, and AFNI.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll showcase the most important features of the statistics-related functionality of the package in a step-by-step fashion. Notably, this notebook contains several exercises (which we call \"ToDos\"), which are meant to make this tutorial more interactive! Also, this tutorial is merely an introduction to (parts of) the Nilearn package. We strongly recommend checking out the excellent [user guide](https://nilearn.github.io/user_guide.html) and [example gallery](https://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/index.html) on the Nilearn website if you want to delve deeper into the package's (more advanced) features.\n",

    "While not strictly necessary, you'll get the most out of this tutorial if you are familiar with the Nilearn package. To familiarize yourself, you could go through our [Nilearn tutorial](https://github.com/lukassnoek/nilearn-tutorial). (For students doing either of the *Neuroimaging* courses at the University of Amsterdam: the `nilearn.ipynb` notebook should be in your home-folder already.) Also, this notebook contains a very short introduction to the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package, but this can be skipped by those who are already familiar with it.\n",

    "## What is Nilearn?\n",
    "Nilearn is one of the packages in the growing \"nipy\" ecosystem of Python packages for neuroimaging analysis (see also MNE, nilearn, nipype, nibabel, and dipy). One of the (recently added) features of the package is the ability to run statistical (mostly univariate) analyses of fMRI data. (This functionality was previously implemented in the \"Nistats\" package, which has been merged into Nilearn recently.) Importantly, Nilearn does not contain functionality to preprocess your (f)MRI data and assumes that your data has been preprocessed by another software package. Personally, we think it works very well in combination with preprocessed data using the [Fmriprep](https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/) package."

    "## Data formats\n",
    "The two most important data formats that are used in the Nilearn package are nifti images and comma- or tab-separated values (CSV, TSV) text files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nifti images\n",
    "Like most packages in the *nipy* ecosystem, Nilearn assumes that your MRI data is stored in nifti images, and as such, many functions in Nilearn involving nifti images accept either strings pointing towards the path of a nifti file (or a list with multiple paths) or a `Nifti1Image` object from the `nibabel` package. Together, these two types of inputs (filenames pointing to nifti files and `Nifti1Images`) are often referred to a \"niimgs\" (or \"niimg-like\") by Nilearn â€” a term you'll see a lot in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's actually download some data! In this tutorial, we use data from the [NARPS](https://www.narps.info/) project ([Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2019a](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0113-7); [Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2019b](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/843193v1)). This public dataset was analyzed by 70 different research groups to showcase the variety in analysis approaches and the way this affects the subsequent results. In the study, a \"mixed gambles\" experiment was used to investigate how potential monetary gains and losses are related to brain activity (which was based on the experiment by [Tom et al., 2007](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5811/515)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Each trial, participants were presented simulatenously with a potential monetary \"gain\" (e.g., <b><font color='green'>+12</font></b>) and a potential monetary \"loss\" (e.g., <b><font color='red'>-6</font></b>. For each trial, participants had to choose whether to accept this gamble (either \"strongly accept\", \"weakly accept\", \"weakly reject\", or \"strongly reject\"), knowing that at the end of the experiment, one trial (\"gamble\") would be picked randomly and (if chosen) would be \"run\" with a 50/50 chance of losing the original \"loss\" amount and winning the original \"gain\" amount. As such, the following information was recorded per trial: potential gain amount, potential loss amount, reaction time (of participant's response), and the participant's choice/decision. "

We recommend you check out the ample excellent tutorials and examples on the Nilearn [website](https://nilearn.github.io/) or to check out the codebase on [Github](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn). As said before, Nilearn is a relatively novel project and its codebase may still change, so keep an eye out for new releases and extended functionality!\n",
