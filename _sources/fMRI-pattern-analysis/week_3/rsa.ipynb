Specifically for RSA, some people use *multivariate* noise normalization, which additionally incorporates the noise *covariance* between voxels. Like the temporal \"uncorrelation\" method we discussed in week 1, multivariate noise normalization effectively uncorrelates the data, yet this time in the *spatial* dimension. One often-cited reason for multivariate noise normalization in representational similarity analyses is that some distance metrics (discussed later) assume that the brain feature (e.g., voxels) of the data are independent.\n",

    "## Exploratory analysis using MDS\n",
    "Most applications of RSA involve relating *neural* RDMs with RDMs based on experimental features (which we'll discuss in the next section). However, you can also do exploratory analyses on your neural RDM only! This is usually done by investigating the (dis)similarity structure (or \"representational geometry\" in RSA terms), usually in a 2D or 3D space. \n",
    "\n",
    "As pattern analyses are often applied to very high-dimensional data (i.e., patterns with many brain features, $K$), people often project the data (i.e., the patterns) into a lower dimensional space. We already encountered one such method in week 1: PCA! However, when interested in the (dis)similarity structure of your data, *multidimensional scaling* (MDS) is more appropriate. Just like PCA, this technique aims to create combinations of features into a lower-dimensional subset of components, such that the high-dimensional distances are presented as much as possible in the lower-dimensional space. For example, if the distance between A and B is 436 in high-dimensional space (e.g., $K=500$), MDS tries to create a lower-dimensional space (usually 2 components) in which the distance between A and B is as close as possible to 436 (as well as all other distances between patterns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, scikit-learn contains an implementation of MDS that uses the familiar `fit`/`transform` methods. Importantly, it can take in a $N\\times K$ matrix (like our pattern matrix $\\mathbf{R}$) and compute the high-dimensional distance structure (i.e., the RDM) internally or you can give it your precomputed RDM. In the latter case, you need to initialize it with `dissimilarity='prepcomputed'`, which is what we're going to do:"

If we used the entire (flattened) RDM, we'd \"artifically\" create twice as many datapoints (i.e. the pairwise dissimilarities) than there really are, which will inflate the significance of the correlation between the RDMs because of increased sample size. So, instead of using all $N\\cdot N$ pairwise differences from the RDM, we need to extract only the flattened $N\\times (N-1)/2$ pairwise dissimilarity values, the \"representational dissimilarity vector\" (RDV) if you will.
