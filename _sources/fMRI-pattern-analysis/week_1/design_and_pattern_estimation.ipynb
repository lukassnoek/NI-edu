    "Functional MRI data are most often stored as 4D data, with 3 spatial dimensions ($X$, $Y$, and $Z$) and 1 temporal dimension ($T$). But most pattern analyses assume that data are formatted in 2D: trials ($N$) by patterns (often a subset of $X$, $Y$, and $Z$). Where did the time dimension ($T$) go? And how do we \"extract\" the patterns of the $N$ trials? In this lab, we'll take a look at various methods to estimate patterns from fMRI time series. Because these methods often depend on your experimental design (and your research question, of course), the first part of this lab will discuss some experimental design considerations. After this more theoretical part, we'll dive into how to estimate patterns from fMRI data.\n",

    "## Experimental design\n",
    "Before you can do any fancy machine learning or representational similarity analysis (or any other pattern analysis), there are several decisions you need to make and steps to take in terms of study design, (pre)processing, and structuring your data. Roughly, there are three steps to take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design your study in a way that's appropriate to answer your question through a pattern analysis; this, of course, needs to be done *before* data acquisition!\n",
    "2. Estimate/extract your patterns from the (functional) MRI data;\n",
    "3. Structure and preprocess your data appropriately for pattern analyses;\n",
    "\n",
    "While we won't go into all the design factors that make for an *efficient* pattern analysis (see [this article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S105381191400768X) for a good review), we will now discuss/demonstrate some design considerations and how they impact the rest of the MVPA pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Within-subject vs. between-subject analyses\n",
    "As always, your experimental design depends on your specific research question. If, for example, you're trying to predict schizophrenia patients from healthy controls based on structural MRI, your experimental design is going to be different than when you, for example, are comparing fMRI activity patterns in the amygdala between trials targeted to induce different emotions. Crucially, with *design* we mean the factors that you as a researcher control: e.g., which schizophrenia patients and healthy control to scan in the former example and which emotion trials to present at what time. These two examples indicate that experimental design considerations are quite different when you are trying to model a factor that varies *between subjects* (the schizophrenia vs. healthy control example) versus a factor that varies *within subjects* (the emotion trials example)."

    "### What makes up a \"pattern\"?\n",
    "So far, we talked a lot about \"patterns\", but what do we mean with that term? There are different options with regard to *what you choose as your unit of measurement* that makes up your pattern. The far majority of pattern analyses in functional MRI use patterns of *activity estimates*, i.e., the same unit of measurement &mdash; relative (de)activation &mdash; as is common in standard mass-univariate analyses. For example, decoding object category (e.g., images of faces vs. images of houses) from fMRI activity patterns in inferotemporal cortex is an example of a pattern analysis that uses *activity estimates* as its unit of measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you are definitely not limited to using *activity estimates* for your patterns. For example, you could apply pattern analyses to structural data (e.g., patterns of voxelwise gray-matter volume values, like in [voxel-based morphometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel-based_morphometry)) or to functional connectivity data (e.g., patterns of time series correlations between voxels, or even topological properties of brain networks). (In fact, the connectivity examples from the Nilearn tutorial represents a way to estimate these connectivity features, which can be used in pattern analyses.) In short, pattern analyses can be applied to patterns composed of *any* type of measurement or metric!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's get a little more technical. Usually, as mentioned in the beginning, pattern analyses represent the data as a 2D array of brain patterns. Let's call this $\\mathbf{R}$. The rows of $\\mathbf{R}$ represent different instances of patterns (sometimes called \"samples\" or \"observations\") and the columns represent different brain features (e.g., voxels; sometimes simply called \"features\"). Note that we thus lose all spatial information by \"flattening\" our patterns into 1D rows!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's call the number of samples $N$ and the number of brain features $K$. We can thus represent $\\mathbf{R}$ as a $N\\times K$ matrix (2D array):\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathbf{R} = \n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    " R_{1,1} & R_{1,2} & R_{1,3} & \\dots & R_{1,K}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed before, the values themselves (e.g., $R_{1,1}$, $R_{1,2}$, $R_{3,6}$) represent whatever you chose for your patterns (fMRI activity, connectivity estimates, VBM, etc.). What is represented by the rows (samples/observations) of $\\mathbf{R}$ depends on your study design: in between-subject studies, these are usually participants, while in within-subject studies, these samples represent trials (or averages of trials or sometimes runs). The columns of $\\mathbf{R}$ represent the different (brain) features in your pattern; for example, these may be different voxels (or sensors/magnetometers in EEG/MEG), vertices (when working with cortical surfaces), edges in functional brain networks, etc. etc. \n",

Or 500? Actually, this is impossible to visualize or even make sense of mentally. As the famous artificial intelligence researcher Geoffrey Hinton put it:\n",

For example, PCA tries to a subset of uncorrelated lower-dimensional features (e.g., 2) from  linear combinations of high-dimensional features (e.g., 4) that still represent as much variance of the high-dimensional components as possible.

    "### Important side note: single trials vs. (runwise) average trials\n",
    "In this section, we often assume that our \"samples\" refer to different *trials*, i.e., single instances of a stimulus or response (or another experimentally-related factor). This is, however, not the only option. Sometimes, researchers choose to treat multiple repetitions of a trial as a single sample or multiple trials within a condition as a single sample. For example, suppose you design a simple passive-viewing experiment with images belonging two one of three conditions: faces, houses, and chairs. Each condition has ten exemplars (face1, face2, ..., face10, house1, house2, ..., house10, chair1, chair2, ... , chair10) and each exemplar/item is repeated six times. So, in total there are 3 (condition) $\\times$ 10 (examplars) $\\times$ 6 (repetitions) = 180 trials. Because you don't want to bore the participant to death, you split the 180 trials into two runs (90 each).\n",
    "    \n",
    "Now, there are different ways to define your samples. One is to treat every single trial as a sample (so you'll have a 180 samples). Another way is to treat each exemplar as a sample. If you do so, you'll have to \"pool\" the pattern estimates across all 6 repetitions (so you'll have $10 \\times 3 = 30$ samples). And yet another way is to treat each condition as a sample, so you'll have to pool the pattern estimates across all 6 repetitions and 10 exemplars per condition (so you'll end up with only 3 samples). Lastly, with respect to the latter two approaches, you may choose to only average repetitions and/or exemplars *within* runs. So, for two runs, you end up with either $10 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 60$ samples (when averaging across repetitions only) or $3 \\times 2 = 6$ samples (when averaging across examplars and repetitions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you should perform your pattern analysis on the trial, examplar, or condition level, and whether you should estimate these patterns across runs or within runs, depends on your research question and analysis technique. For example, if you want to decode exemplars from each other, you obviously should not average across exemplars. Also, some experiments may not have different exemplars per condition (or do not have categorical conditions at all). With respect to the importance of analysis technique: when applying machine learning analyses to fMRI data, people often prefer to split their trials across many (short) runs and &mdash; if using a categorical design &mdash; prefer to estimate a single pattern per run. This is because samples across runs are not temporally autocorrelated, which is an important assumption in machine learning based analyses. Lastly, for any pattern analysis, averaging across different trials will increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for any sample (because you average out noise), but will decrease the statistical power of the analysis (because you have fewer samples). \n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short: whatever you treat as a sample &mdash; single trials, (runwise) exemplars or (runwise) conditions &mdash; depends on your design, research question, and analysis technique. In the rest of the tutorial, we will usually refer to samples as \"trials\", as this scenario is easiest to simulate and visualize, but remember that this term may equally well refer to (runwise) exemplar-average or condition-average patterns.\n",

Note that you are not necessarily limited to discrete categorical designs for all pattern analyses! While for machine learning-based methods (topic of week 2) it is common to have a design with a single categorical feature of interest (or some times a single continuous one),  representional similarity analyses (topic of week 3) are often applied to data with more \"rich\" designs (i.e., designs that include many, often continuously varying, factors of interest).

For example, if you present a trial at $t=10$ and another at $t=12$ and subsequently extract the pattern six seconds post-stimulus (at $t=18$ for the second trial), then the activity estimate for the second trial is definitely going to contain activity due to the first trial because of the sluggishness of the HRF. \n",

Note that, as explained before, a sample can refer to either a single trial, a set of repetitions of a particuar exemplar, or even a single condition. For now, we'll assume that samples refer to single trials. Often, each sample is modelled by a single (canonical) HRF-convolved regressor (but you could also use more than one regressor, e.g., using a basis set with temporal/dispersion derivatives or a FIR-based basis set), so we'll focus on this approach.\n",

Importantly, we should make sure to give a separate and unique \"trial_type\" values for all our trials.

    "## Dealing with trial correlations\n",
    "When working with single-trial experimental designs (such as the LSA designs discussed previously), one often occurring problem is correlation between trial predictors and their resulting estimates. Trial correlations in such designs occur when the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) is sufficiently short such that trial predictors overlap and thus correlate. This, in turn, leads to relatively unstable (high-variance) pattern estimates and, as we will see later in this section, trial patterns that correlate with each other (which is sometimes called [pattern drift](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/032391v2)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the case in our data from the NI-edu dataset. In the \"face\" task, stimuli were presented for 1.25 seconds, followed by a 3.75 ISI, which causes a slightly positive correlation between a given trial ($i$) and the next trial ($i + 1$) and a slightly negative correlation between the trial after that ($i + 2$).

Note, this is a <em>very</em> hard ToDo if you're not very familiar with Python, but a great way to test your programming skills :-)\n",

    "    <b>Tip</b>: Programming your own pattern estimation pipeline allows you to be very flexible and is a great way to practice your programming skills, but if you want a more \"pre-packaged\" tool, I recommend the <a href=\"https://nibetaseries.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\">nibetaseries</a> package. The package's name is derived from a specific analysis technique called \"beta-series correlation\", which is a type of analysis that allows for resting-state like connectivity analyses of task-based fMRI data (which we won't discuss in this course). For this technique, you need to estimate single-trial activity patterns &mdash; just like we need to do for pattern analyses! I've used this package to estimate patterns for pattern analysis and I highly recommend it!\n",

As opposed to the LSS method, the uncorrelation approach takes care of the correlation structure in the data in a post-hoc manner. It does so, in essence, by \"removing\" the correlations in the data that are due to the correlations in the design in a way that is similar to what prewhitening does in generalized least squares.\n",
